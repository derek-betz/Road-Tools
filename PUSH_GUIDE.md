# Repository Split Completion Guide

## Current Status: Ready to Push ✅

All preparation work has been completed. The three application repositories have been:
- ✅ Cloned from GitHub
- ✅ Populated with application files
- ✅ Committed locally

They are ready to be pushed to GitHub.

## What's Been Prepared

### In `/tmp/repo-split/`:

1. **CostEstimateGenerator**
   - Location: `/tmp/repo-split/CostEstimateGenerator`
   - Files: 165 files committed
   - Commit: `ae57f37 Initial commit - extracted from Road-Tools monorepo`
   - Ready to push to: https://github.com/derek-betz/CostEstimateGenerator

2. **submittal-packager**
   - Location: `/tmp/repo-split/submittal-packager`
   - Files: 29 files committed
   - Commit: `91d5df6 Initial commit - extracted from Road-Tools monorepo`
   - Ready to push to: https://github.com/derek-betz/submittal-packager

3. **commitments-reconciler**
   - Location: `/tmp/repo-split/commitments-reconciler`
   - Files: 12 files committed
   - Commit: `08579dc Initial commit - extracted from Road-Tools monorepo`
   - Ready to push to: https://github.com/derek-betz/commitments-reconciler

## How to Complete the Push

### Option A: Using the Push Script (Quickest)

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/Road-Tools/Road-Tools
./scripts/push_split_repositories.sh
```

This will push all three prepared repositories in one command.

### Option B: Manual Push (Each Repository)

```bash
# CostEstimateGenerator
cd /tmp/repo-split/CostEstimateGenerator
git push -u origin main

# submittal-packager
cd /tmp/repo-split/submittal-packager
git push -u origin main

# commitments-reconciler
cd /tmp/repo-split/commitments-reconciler
git push -u origin main
```

### Option C: GitHub Actions Workflow

For future splits or if the `/tmp/repo-split/` directory is no longer available:

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope
2. Add it as a repository secret named `SPLIT_REPO_TOKEN` in the Road-Tools repository
3. Go to: https://github.com/derek-betz/Road-Tools/actions/workflows/split-repository.yml
4. Click "Run workflow", type "yes", and click "Run workflow"

## Verification After Push

Once pushed, verify each repository:

1. Visit each repository URL and confirm files are present
2. Clone each repository and test:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/derek-betz/<repository-name>.git
   cd <repository-name>
   pip install -e .[test]
   pytest -q
   ```

3. Verify GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows run successfully

## Why Authentication is Required

The repositories are prepared locally but cannot be automatically pushed because:
- The GitHub Actions token is scoped only to the Road-Tools repository
- Pushing to other repositories requires explicit authentication with appropriate permissions
- This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized access to other repositories

## Next Steps After Successful Push

1. Update links in the Road-Tools README to point to the new repositories
2. Consider archiving or updating the Road-Tools repository
3. Set up branch protection rules on the new repositories
4. Configure access controls and permissions
5. Update any documentation or CI/CD configurations that reference the old monorepo structure
