# Repository Split - Completion Report

## Executive Summary

✅ **PREPARATION COMPLETE**: All three application repositories have been successfully extracted from the Road-Tools monorepo and prepared for deployment to their respective GitHub repositories.

- ✅ Configuration files (pyproject.toml, .gitignore)
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- ✅ Application-specific resources (examples, templates, data, scripts)

### 3. Verification ✅
Each repository has been verified to contain:
- All expected directories and files
- Proper git configuration
- Valid commit history
- Correct remote URLs

### 4. Documentation ✅
Comprehensive documentation has been created:
- **FINAL_PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Complete guide with multiple push options
- **READY_TO_PUSH.md** - Quick status and commands
- **SPLIT_STATUS.md** - Updated with current status
- **README.md** - Updated with push instructions
- **scripts/prepare_split_repositories.sh** - Script for future use

## What Remains To Be Done

### Single Step Required: Push to GitHub

All that remains is to execute the `git push` command for each repository. This requires GitHub authentication with push access to the three target repositories.

**Three commands to complete the split:**

```bash
cd /tmp/repo-split/CostEstimateGenerator && git push -u origin main
cd /tmp/repo-split/submittal-packager && git push -u origin main
cd /tmp/repo-split/commitments-reconciler && git push -u origin main
```

**Or use the convenience script:**

```bash
/home/runner/work/Road-Tools/Road-Tools/scripts/push_split_repositories.sh
```

### Why Authentication is Required

The prepared repositories are in a temporary directory (`/tmp/repo-split/`) with git remotes configured to the GitHub repositories. The git push command requires authentication to write to these remote repositories. Authentication options include:

1. **SSH keys** configured for GitHub
2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with repo scope
3. **GitHub Actions** with SPLIT_REPO_TOKEN secret
4. **GitHub CLI** (`gh auth login`)

---

## Verification After Push

Once the push is complete, verify each repository:

### 1. Check GitHub Web Interface
Visit each repository and confirm files are present:
- https://github.com/derek-betz/CostEstimateGenerator
- https://github.com/derek-betz/submittal-packager
- https://github.com/derek-betz/commitments-reconciler

### 2. Verify CI/CD Workflows
Check the Actions tab in each repository to ensure the CI workflow runs successfully.

### 3. Test Local Clone (Recommended)
Clone each repository and run tests:

```bash
# Test CostEstimateGenerator
git clone https://github.com/derek-betz/CostEstimateGenerator.git
cd CostEstimateGenerator
pip install -e .[test]
pytest -q

# Test submittal-packager
git clone https://github.com/derek-betz/submittal-packager.git
cd submittal-packager
pip install -e .[test]
pytest -q

# Test commitments-reconciler
git clone https://github.com/derek-betz/commitments-reconciler.git
cd commitments-reconciler
pip install -e .[test]
pytest -q
```

---

## Success Criteria

The repository split will be complete when:
- ✅ All files are present in each GitHub repository
- ✅ CI/CD workflows run successfully on initial push
- ✅ Each repository can be cloned and tested independently
- ✅ Repository structure matches the prepared versions in `/tmp/repo-split/`

---

## Alternative Approaches

If `/tmp/repo-split/` is no longer available or you prefer to re-prepare:

### Method 1: Run the full split script
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/Road-Tools/Road-Tools
./scripts/split_repositories.sh
```
(Requires authentication - will clone, copy, commit, and push in one step)

### Method 2: Use GitHub Actions workflow
1. Add SPLIT_REPO_TOKEN secret to Road-Tools repository
2. Go to https://github.com/derek-betz/Road-Tools/actions/workflows/split-repository.yml
3. Click "Run workflow", type "yes", and run

### Method 3: Manual process (if needed)
Follow the detailed steps in SPLIT_GUIDE.md for manual copying and pushing.

---

## Timeline

- **Repository preparation**: Completed
- **Documentation creation**: Completed  
- **Final push**: Pending (requires authentication)
- **Estimated time to complete**: < 5 minutes with authentication

---

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. See **FINAL_PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md** for detailed troubleshooting
2. Review error messages carefully if push fails
3. Verify you have push access to all three target repositories
4. Check GitHub status page if experiencing connectivity issues

---

## Summary

All technical work to extract and prepare the three applications has been completed successfully. The applications are fully independent, properly configured, and ready to function as standalone repositories. The only remaining step is the authenticated push to GitHub, which takes seconds to complete once authentication is available.

**Status**: Ready for deployment ✅  
**Blocker**: Requires GitHub authentication for push  
**Resolution**: Execute three `git push` commands or run provided script
