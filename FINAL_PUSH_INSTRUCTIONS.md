# Repository Split - Final Push Instructions

## Current Status: ✅ Prepared and Ready to Push

All three application repositories have been successfully:
- ✅ Cloned from their initialized GitHub repositories
- ✅ Populated with all application files, including:
  - Source code
  - Tests
  - Documentation (README, LICENSE)
  - Configuration files (.gitignore, pyproject.toml)
  - GitHub Actions workflows (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  - Additional resources (examples, templates, data, scripts)
- ✅ Committed locally with descriptive commit messages

The repositories are in `/tmp/repo-split/` and only require the final `git push` command.

## How to Complete the Push

### Option 1: Push Manually (Recommended if on this machine)

Since the repositories are already prepared in `/tmp/repo-split/`, you can push them directly:

```bash
# Push CostEstimateGenerator
cd /tmp/repo-split/CostEstimateGenerator
git push -u origin main

# Push submittal-packager
cd /tmp/repo-split/submittal-packager
git push -u origin main

# Push commitments-reconciler
cd /tmp/repo-split/commitments-reconciler
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Use the Push Script

A convenience script is available to push all three at once:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/Road-Tools/Road-Tools
./scripts/push_split_repositories.sh
```

### Option 3: GitHub Actions Workflow

If you prefer to use GitHub Actions (or if `/tmp/repo-split/` is no longer available):

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope at https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Add it as a repository secret named `SPLIT_REPO_TOKEN` in the Road-Tools repository:
   - Go to https://github.com/derek-betz/Road-Tools/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `SPLIT_REPO_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your PAT
3. Run the workflow:
   - Go to https://github.com/derek-betz/Road-Tools/actions/workflows/split-repository.yml
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Type "yes" to confirm
   - Click "Run workflow" button

### Option 4: Re-prepare and Push (If /tmp/repo-split/ is gone)

If the prepared repositories in `/tmp/repo-split/` are no longer available:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/Road-Tools/Road-Tools
./scripts/split_repositories.sh
```

This will clone, copy, commit, and push in one step (requires authentication).

## What Happens After Push

Once pushed, each repository will:
1. Have all its files available on GitHub
2. Be fully independent from the Road-Tools monorepo
3. Have its own CI/CD workflow that will run on the first push
4. Be ready for independent development and releases

## Verification Steps

After pushing, verify each repository:

1. **Visit each repository on GitHub:**
   - https://github.com/derek-betz/CostEstimateGenerator
   - https://github.com/derek-betz/submittal-packager
   - https://github.com/derek-betz/commitments-reconciler

2. **Check that all files are present** (browse the file tree on GitHub)

3. **Verify CI/CD workflows run successfully:**
   - Check the Actions tab in each repository
   - The CI workflow should trigger automatically on push

4. **Clone and test locally** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Test CostEstimateGenerator
   git clone https://github.com/derek-betz/CostEstimateGenerator.git
   cd CostEstimateGenerator
   pip install -e .[test]
   pytest -q
   
   # Test submittal-packager
   git clone https://github.com/derek-betz/submittal-packager.git
   cd submittal-packager
   pip install -e .[test]
   pytest -q
   
   # Test commitments-reconciler
   git clone https://github.com/derek-betz/commitments-reconciler.git
   cd commitments-reconciler
   pip install -e .[test]
   pytest -q
   ```

## Next Steps After Successful Push

Once all three repositories are successfully pushed:

1. **Update the Road-Tools README** to point to the new repositories
2. **Consider archiving the Road-Tools repository** (optional)
3. **Set up branch protection rules** on the new repositories
4. **Configure access controls** for collaborators
5. **Update any CI/CD pipelines** or documentation that reference the old monorepo structure
6. **Announce the split** to team members and stakeholders

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you get "Authentication failed" errors:
- Make sure you have push access to the target repositories
- Check that your GitHub credentials are configured correctly
- Consider using a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of password authentication

### Repository Already Contains Files

If you get errors about the repository not being empty:
- The initial README files in the target repositories will be replaced by the full application code
- Git should handle this automatically during the push

### Large File Warnings

If you see warnings about large files:
- This is normal for repositories with sample data or binary files
- The push should still succeed
- Consider using Git LFS for very large files in future commits

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs if using the workflow approach
2. Review the error messages carefully
3. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for all three repositories
4. Contact the repository administrator if permissions are needed
