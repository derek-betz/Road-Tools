## CostEstimateGenerator Analysis Report

### Executive Summary
The batch evaluation of CostEstimateGenerator against 6 recent bid contracts reveals significant accuracy challenges that present clear improvement opportunities.

### Performance Metrics
- **Total Pay Items Evaluated**: 13,266 items across 6 contracts
- **Overall RMSE**: $12,882 per item
- **Overall MAPE**: 32.04% (industry target typically <15-20%)
- **Alternate-Seek Usage**: 0% (AI fallback never triggered)

### Key Findings from Error Analysis

1. **High Variance Items**: Several items show extreme percentage errors (>100%), indicating potential issues with:
   - Outlier filtering in historical bid data
   - Regional/temporal weighting of price data
   - Item code matching accuracy

2. **Missing Estimates**: Many items lack estimates entirely (blank UNIT_PRICE_EST), suggesting:
   - Insufficient historical data coverage
   - Overly restrictive filtering criteria
   - Potential for better fallback pricing methods

3. **Systematic Overestimation**: Several items (e.g., 105-06845: actual $105, estimated $13,000) indicate:
   - Possible contamination from unrelated/mismatched historical records
   - Need for improved bid tab filtering by contract size/type
   - Better statistical outlier detection

### Recommended Improvements for API AI Implementation

#### 1. Enhanced Data Quality & Filtering
- Implement smarter contract filtering based on project type, not just dollar value
- Add geographic proximity weighting for historical bid selection
- Improve item code normalization and fuzzy matching

#### 2. Statistical Method Upgrades
- Replace simple mean with robust estimators (median, trimmed mean)
- Implement confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- Add temporal decay weighting for older bid data

#### 3. AI-Enhanced Fallback Logic
- Activate Alternate-Seek for items with insufficient historical data
- Implement similarity-based pricing using item descriptions and specifications
- Add cross-validation to identify and correct systematic biases

#### 4. Process Streamlining
- Automate periodic retraining with new bid data
- Implement real-time accuracy tracking and alerts
- Add interactive feedback loops for manual price adjustments

### Next Steps
1. Implement robust statistical methods for outlier detection and price normalization
2. Enhance the Alternate-Seek AI module to handle sparse data items
3. Add contract similarity analysis to improve historical data selection
4. Create automated accuracy monitoring and continuous improvement workflows

The evaluation framework is now in place to iteratively test and validate these improvements against real bid outcomes.
