Certainly! Here's a pragmatic modernization plan for INDOT's cost-estimation process, addressing alternate-seek, upstream data processing, and reporting, with actionable recommendations and references to best practices.

## 1. Sustainable Alternate-Seek Framework

**Goal:** When BidTabs coverage is insufficient (e.g., <min_sample_target>), reliably estimate pay item costs by blending multiple authoritative sources and transparent logic.

### a. Data Sources & Hierarchy

- **Primary:** BidTabs (historical contract-level pricing, filtered by region, contract size, recency, and geometry)
- **Secondary:** Statewide unit price averages (by item code, spec section, and year)
- **Tertiary:** Specification-driven analogs (using item description, dimensions, and related spec sections)
- **Quaternary:** AI/ML similarity scoring (semantic and numeric, with explainability)

### b. Alternate-Seek Algorithm

1. **Coverage Check:** For each pay item, count qualifying BidTabs records.
   - If  min_sample_target, use regionally filtered BidTabs analytics.
   - If < min_sample_target, proceed to alternate-seek.

2. **Similarity Search:**
   - Use AI/ML to find similar items (by geometry, description, and spec section).
   - Score candidates (geometry, spec, recency, locality, data volume).
   - If top candidate(s) meet a minimum overall similarity threshold (e.g., >0.7), use their weighted average, noting adjustments.

3. **Statewide Fallback:**
   - If no similar items meet threshold, use statewide averages for the item code or nearest spec section.

4. **Specification-Based Estimation:**
   - If no direct pricing, use spec section text and engineering judgment to estimate (e.g., cost per unit from similar items, adjusted for size/material).

5. **AI/ML Assistance:**
   - Use LLMs to suggest analogs and document rationale, but require human review for low-confidence matches.

6. **Audit Trail:**
   - For each alternate-seek, log: data sources, candidate items, similarity scores, rationale, and final selection.

### c. Sustainability Features

- **Continuous Learning:** As new BidTabs data arrives, retrain similarity models and update statewide averages.
- **Transparency:** All alternate-seek decisions are logged and exportable for audit.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** For low-confidence or high-value items, require estimator approval.

## 2. Upstream Data Processing Improvements

### a. Data Ingestion

- **Automate Extraction:** Use ETL tools (e.g., Azure Data Factory, Python scripts) to ingest BidTabs, quantities, and specs from source systems.
- **Schema Validation:** Enforce schemas for item codes, units, dates, and contract attributes.

### b. Data Cleansing

- **Normalization:** Standardize item codes, units, and descriptions (e.g., mapping legacy codes, resolving synonyms).
- **Deduplication:** Remove duplicate entries and resolve conflicting records.
- **Outlier Detection:** Flag and review anomalous unit prices (e.g., z-score or IQR-based).

### c. QA/QC

- **Automated Checks:** Validate row counts, missing fields, and logical consistency (e.g., contract size bounds).
- **Manual Spot-Checks:** Randomly sample records for human review, especially for new or rare items.
- **Version Control:** Track data revisions and maintain a changelog.

### d. Analytics

- **Dynamic Filtering:** Enable contract-size, region, and recency filters in analytics.
- **Weighted Averages:** Use quantity-weighted averages for unit prices.
- **Confidence Scoring:** For each estimate, calculate and export a confidence score based on data volume and similarity.

## 3. "Show the Work" in Reports and Exports

### a. Calculation Documentation

- **Estimate_Draft.xlsx:** For each pay item, include:
  - Data source(s) used (BidTabs, statewide, analog, AI/ML)
  - Number of records and date range
  - Filters applied (region, contract size, etc.)
  - Weighted average calculation (with sample size)
  - Similarity scores and candidate items (if alternate-seek)
  - Manual overrides or adjustments (with rationale)

- **Estimate_Audit.csv:** Export a row per pay item with:
  - Item code, description, unit
  - All candidate items considered (with scores)
  - Final selection and reason
  - Data sufficiency flag (met/not met)

- **PayItems_Audit.xlsx:** Include:
  - Full calculation chain for each item
  - Links to source contracts/specs
  - AI/ML notes and human review status

### b. Transparency & Traceability

- **Unique Estimate IDs:** Assign unique IDs to each estimate run for traceability.
- **Exportable Logs:** All calculations and decisions are exportable for external QA or audit.
- **"Explain This Estimate" Button:** In the UI, allow users to view the full calculation chain for any pay item.

## 4. Metrics, Controls, and Modernization Opportunities

### a. Key Metrics

- **Coverage Rate:** % of pay items with  min_sample_target BidTabs records.
- **Alternate-Seek Frequency:** % of items requiring alternate-seek.
- **Estimate Confidence Score:** Weighted by data sufficiency and similarity.
- **Manual Override Rate:** % of items requiring estimator intervention.
- **Cycle Time:** Time from data ingestion to estimate completion.

### b. Controls

- **Threshold Alerts:** Notify when data coverage drops below thresholds.
- **Audit Sampling:** Regularly review a sample of alternate-seek and AI-assisted estimates.
- **Data Quality Dashboards:** Monitor ingestion, cleansing, and analytics health.

### c. Modernization Opportunities

- **Cloud Data Lake:** Centralize BidTabs, specs, and project data for scalable analytics (Azure, AWS, etc.).
- **ML Model Registry:** Version and track similarity models and their performance.
- **Feedback Loop:** Allow estimators to flag poor analogs, improving future AI recommendations.
- **Integration with e-Construction:** Link cost estimates to digital project delivery platforms.
- **Open Data Publishing:** Share sanitized unit price data for industry benchmarking.

### d. Best Practice References

- **AASHTO Guide for Estimating (2013):** Emphasizes data-driven, transparent, and auditable processes.
- **FHWA Cost Estimation Validation Process:** Recommends multi-source, hierarchical estimation with documentation.
- **NCHRP 08-49:** Advocates for similarity scoring and alternate-seek when primary data is sparse.
- **GAO Cost Estimating Guide:** Stresses traceability, transparency, and continuous improvement.

**In summary:**  
INDOT should implement a multi-source, score-based alternate-seek framework; automate and QA all upstream data flows; require transparent, exportable calculation documentation; and track key metrics for continuous improvement. This aligns with national best practices and positions INDOT for future-ready, sustainable cost estimation.
