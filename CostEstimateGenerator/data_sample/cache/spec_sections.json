The above referenced CFR section requires the following policy and 15\ndisadvantaged business enterprise obligation to be included in all subsequent agreements between the Contractor and all subcontractors as follows:\n1. It will be the policy of the Department to create a level\nplaying field on which DBE\u2019s can compete fairly for 20\nfederally funded contracts. Consequently, the disadvantaged business enterprise requirements of 49 CFR Part 26, as outlined in the Department\u2019s DBE Program Manual, apply to this contract. 103.01\n15  25\n2. The Contractor shall not discriminate on the basis of race,\ncolor, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity in the award and performance of this contract. The Contractor shall carry out the applicable DBE\nrequirements in the award and administration of federally 30\nfunded contracts. Failure by the Contractor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of this contract which may result in the termination of this contract or such other remedy as the Department deems appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to: withholding progress payments; 35\nassessing sanctions; liquidated damages; and/or disqualifying the Contractor from future bidding as non-responsible. The Contractor shall include language prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation or gender 40\nidentity in the performance of this contract and all\nsubcontracts.\n(b) Definitions\nThe following definitions will apply. 45\n1.

Such goal,\nif required, has been established as the desired minimum amount to be contracted to\nDBEs. The Contractor shall meet or exceed the goal or demonstrate that it could not\nbe met despite good faith efforts. Achievement of the goal does not relieve the 80\nContractor of the requirement for affirmative action on subsequent subcontracting on this contract. Only work with listed DBEs that are certified prior to the date of the\nletting will count toward the goal. Credit towards contract goals will be given only for work performed by certified DBEs in the work areas for which they have been certified. The same requirements with respect to obtaining the goal apply for a 85\nContractor that is certified as a DBE. A DBE Contractor shall either achieve the goal utilizing other DBE firms or demonstrate that the goal could not be met despite good\nfaith efforts.\nContracting may be in the form of a subcontract, lease agreement, or material 90\nsupply agreement. Prime contractors will receive 100% credit for work done by the DBE under subcontracts and lease agreements. Credit for utilization of a DBE material\nsupplier depends on whether the supplier is a manufacturer, regular dealer, or broker. Full credit will be given for suppliers who manufacture the items and are certified as Supplier Manufacturer in the DBE repository. Credit will be limited to 60% of the 95\nexpenditure for suppliers acting as a regular dealer and are certified as Supplier Regular Dealer in the DBE repository. Credit will be limited to fees and commissions for suppliers acting as a broker and are certified as Supplier Broker in the DBE\nrepository. Suppliers shall also perform a commercially useful function in order for\ncredit to be received. 100\nThe Contractor shall not terminate or reduce a commitment to a DBE, or an\napproved substitute DBE listed on the Affirmative Action Certification without the prior written consent of the Department. This includes, but is not limited to, instances in which the Contractor seeks to perform work originally designated for a DBE 105\nsubcontractor with its own forces or those of an affiliate, a non-DBE firm, or with another DBE firm. Unless the Department provides written consent, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any payment for work or materials unless it is performed or\nsupplied by the listed DBE. Written consent will be provided based on the Contractor\nmeeting all requirements outlined in 49 CFR 26.53, Department policy, and as stated 110\nherein. The Contractor shall make good faith efforts within seven business days of\nDepartment consent to obtain additional DBE participation.\nWritten consent will only be provided by the Department if the Contractor has good cause to terminate or reduce its commitment to the DBE firm. Good cause shall 115\nconsist of any of the following circumstances: 103.01\n17\n1. The listed DBE subcontractor fails or refuses to execute a\nwritten contract.\n120\n2. The listed DBE subcontractor fails or refuses to perform the\nwork of its subcontract in a manner consistent with normal\nindustry standards, unless such failure or refusal of the DBE subcontractor to perform its work on the subcontract results from the bad faith or discriminatory action of the Contractor. 125\n3. The listed DBE subcontractor fails or refuses to meet\nthe Contractor's reasonable, nondiscriminatory bond requirements.\n130\n4. The listed DBE subcontractor becomes bankrupt, insolvent,\nor exhibits credit unworthiness.\n\n5. The listed DBE subcontractor is ineligible to work on public\nworks projects because of suspension and debarment 135\nproceedings pursuant to 2 CFR Parts 180, 215 and 1200 or\napplicable state law.\n6. The Department has determined that the listed DBE\nsubcontractor is not a responsible contractor. 140\n7. The listed DBE subcontractor voluntarily withdraws from\nthe project and provides the Department written notice of its withdrawal.\n145\n8. The listed DBE is ineligible to receive DBE credit for the\ntype of work required.\n9. A DBE owner dies or becomes disabled with the result that\nthe listed DBE contractor is unable to complete its work on 150\nthe contract.\n10. Other documented good causes, that the Department will\ndetermine, which compels the termination of the DBE subcontractor. Good cause does not exist, however, if the 155\nContractor seeks to terminate a DBE it relied upon to obtain\nthe contract so that it can self-perform the work for which the\nDBE contractor was engaged or so that the Contractor can substitute another DBE or non-DBE contractor after the contract has been awarded. 160\nBefore transmitting to the Department its request to terminate or reduce a 103.01\n18 commitment made to a listed DBE, the Contractor shall give written notice to the\naffected DBE, with a copy to the Department, of its intent to request termination or reduction and the reasons for the request. The DBE shall be given five days to respond 165\nto the Contractor and the Department of the reasons, if any, why it objects to the proposed termination or reduction, and why the Department should not approve the\nContractor\u2019s action. If required in a particular case, as a matter of public necessity and\nsafety, the Department may specify a response period shorter than five days.  170\nWhen a DBE subcontractor is terminated as specified herein or fails to complete its work on the contract for any reason, the Department will require the Contractor to make good faith efforts to find  another DBE subcontractor to substitute for the original\nDBE. These good faith efforts shall be directed at finding another DBE to perform at least the same amount of work under the cont ract as the DBE that was terminated, to 175\nthe extent needed to meet the contract goal the Department established for the contract.   In order to receive DBE credit for commitments made as part of the prime contract award process, a DBE firm shall be certified before the due date for bids on the prime\ncontract. There may be situations after the award of the prime contract in which it is 180\nappropriate to count DBE credit for the use of a DBE firm. To be eligible to obtain DBE credit in these situations, the DBE firm shall be certified prior to participation on the contract.   If a non-DBE contractor joint ventures with a DBE contractor, the portion of the 185\njoint venture which is performed by a DBE may be utilized to achieve the DBE goal. Two types of DBE joint ventures are allowed and are defined as follows:\n1. DBE Joint Venture Type A  A DBE contractor and a non-DBE contractor bidding on specific pay items to be 190\nperformed by each company.\n2. DBE Joint Venture Type B  A DBE contractor and a non-DBE contractor combining resources and agreeing upon a percentage of the total work to be performed by each contractor. 195\nDBE joint ventures Type A do not require DBE joint venture certification. DBE joint ventures Type B do require DBE joint venture certification. A request for DBE joint ventures Type B certification shall be submitted no later than 9:00 a.m. local time\nthe last business day before the letting and shall be approved prior to bidding in order 200\nto receive credit toward the DBE goal. The DBE shall be certified with the Department prior to requesting DBE joint venture certification. The work for the DBE shall be\nidentified, performed, managed, and supervised by its forces.\n(d) Affirmative Actions 205\nThe Contractor shall develop an affirmative action plan for a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program which shall include the minimum requirements as follows: 103.01\n19\n1. Appointment of a representative with authority to administer 210\nthe Contractor\u2019s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program.\n\n2. Documents of affirmative action methods and procedures\nintended to be used in seeking out and considering certified 215\nDBEs as subcontractors or suppliers.\n3. A list of certified DBEs to be contacted prior to the selection\nof a potential subcontractor for the particular pay items within the capabilities of the DBEs. This list shall include but 220\nshall not be limited to the requirements as follows:\na. The name of each subcontractor or supplier and a\nnotation as to their DBE certification status.\n225\nb. The potential type of work or services to be performed\nby each subcontractor or supplier.\n(e) Determination of Good Faith Efforts\nAppendix A of 49 CFR Part 26 has been used for guidance in preparing the 230\nDepartment\u2019s procedures to determine the adequacy of good faith efforts. Additional factors consistent with 49 CFR Part 26, and the Department\u2019s policies and procedures have also been utilized.     1. Good Faith Efforts Prior to Award 235\nThe following factors will be considered in determining good faith efforts prior\nto award of a contract. The Contractor, including DBE Contractors, shall submit\nevidence on each of the factors.      a. The Contractor shall make reasonable effort to contact 240\nall ready, willing, and able DBEs who express a desire to work on any of the pay items of the contract.\nb. To effectively participate, the DBE shall have the\nopportunity to analyze the contract and submit 245\nquotations prior to letting. Information provided by the Contractor to the DBEs shall include, at a minimum, the contract number, pay items, quantities for those pay\nitems to be subcontracted, and the date the subcontract\nbid is desired. 250\nc. The Contractor shall select the portions of the work to\nbe performed by DBEs in order to increase the likelihood of DBE participation. This shall include, 103.01\n20 where appropriate, an attempt to break down the 255\ncontract into economically feasible units to facilitate DBE participation.\nd. The Contractor shall provide the interested DBEs with\ncomplete information about the plans, specifications, 260\nand requirements of the contract. Attempts shall be made to have plans available or to notify the DBE of the location of available plans. The Contractor shall notify the DBE of revisions to the contract.\n265\ne. It will be considered unacceptable to avoid\nsubcontracting to DBEs if such subcontracting to DBEs results in the need to further subdivide remaining work items.\n270\nf. The Contractor shall negotiate in good faith with\ninterested DBEs and not reject such DBEs as\nunqualified without sound reasons based on thorough investigation of their capabilities. Confirmed documentation that a DBE has not been able to perform 275\nprevious work through no fault of others will be considered to be sound reason. Unacceptable criteria include, but are not limited to, unsubstantiated oral statements and unsigned documentation.\n280\ng. The Contractor shall make efforts to assist interested\nDBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance\nrequired by the State. However, the Contractor shall\naffirmatively consider waiving requirements it may have in order to assist the DBE. 285\nh. Only firms certified as DBEs prior to the letting date\ncan be used to meet the contract goal for the Department\u2019s DBE program.\n290\nThe Contractor will be considered to have made good faith efforts if it either:      a. Documents that it has obtained enough DBE\nparticipation to meet the goal, or\n295\nb. Documents that it made adequate good faith efforts in\naccordance with the factors set out above to meet the goal even though it did not succeed in obtaining enough DBE participation to do so.\n300 103.01\n21  If a DBE goal has been established for the contract, the Contractor shall take good\nfaith efforts to achieve the established goal prior to the bid opening. The Affirmative Action Certification shall be completed and submitted with the Proposal to indicate both race/gender conscious and race/gender neutral proposed DBE utilization.  305\nThe award of the contract will be made to the lowest and best bidder when all\nother requirements have been met and good faith efforts have been taken toward meeting the DBE goal, if required, in accordance with these requirements.   If the apparent low bidder has not achieved the contract DBE goal, the bidder shall 310\nrespond by email or in writing within five business days after notification by the\nDepartment of the failure to meet the DBE goal. The response shall provide evidence identifying the bidder\u2019s good faith efforts and all affirmative actions taken prior to letting to achieve the required DBE goal. Failure to respond within the five business day period will result in rejection of the bid, and may result in forfeiture of the bid 315\nbond, and the referral of the bidder to the Prequalification Committee.\nResponses shall be sent to the Department\u2019s Division of Contract Administration.\nThe Department will review the bidder\u2019s good faith efforts for compliance with these requirements. 320\nIf the Department determines that adequate good faith efforts have been made, and the bidder has met all other bidding requirements, the contract will be awarded.   If the Department determines that good faith efforts were inadequate, the 325\nDepartment will notify the bidder of the determination by email. The determination will outline the reasons for determination of non-compliance with good faith effort requirements.\n\nThe bidder may request a review of a determination of non-compliance by email 330\nor written submittal within five business days of the bidder\u2019s receipt of notification of non-compliance from the Department. The request for review shall include evidence disputing the Department\u2019s reasons for issuing a determination of non-compliance. The request shall be sent to the Department\u2019s Division of Contract Administration.  335\nUpon receipt of a request, the Department will contact the bidder to schedule a review. The review will be held by the Department\u2019s Deputy Commissioner and Chief Legal Counsel, or a designee who did not participate in the original determination of non-compliance. The review will be conducted in accordance with the Department\u2019s policy for review of good faith efforts requirements. A copy of the policy is available 340\non the Department\u2019s website or through the Division of Contract Administration.\nIf the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding determines that the bidder\u2019s good faith efforts were adequate, and the bidder has met all other bidding requirements, the contract will be awarded and the Department will adjust the contract time by the 345\nnumber of calendar days from the date of the original determination of non-compliance 103.01\n22 to and including the date of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s findings.\nIf the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding determines that the bidder\u2019s good faith efforts were inadequate, the finding will be forwarded to the Commissioner. The 350\nCommissioner will review the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding and issue a written\nContract Award Determination.\nIf the Commissioner\u2019s Contract Award Determination finds that the bidder\u2019s good faith efforts were adequate, and the bidder has met all other bidding requirements, the 355\ncontract will be awarded and the Department will adjust the contract time by the number of calendar days from the start of the original determination of non-compliance to and including the date of the Commissioner\u2019s determination.   If the Commissioner\u2019s Contract Award Determination finds that the bidder\u2019s good 360\nfaith efforts were inadequate, at the Commissioner\u2019s sole option and without further proceedings, either all bids will be rejected or the contract will be awarded to the next lowest and qualified bidder. An apparent low bidder who has not met the DBE goal\nand requirements for good faith efforts may be requested not to rebid on this contract\nduring subsequent lettings. 365\nThe Commissioner\u2019s Contract Award Determination will be the final decision of the Department.     2. Good Faith Efforts for Extra Work 370\nWhen extra work in accordance with 104.03 is added to a contract with a DBE goal, the Contractor shall hire or make good faith efforts to hire a DBE subcontractor to perform significant extra work.\nFor purposes of DBE good faith efforts, significant extra work is defined as new 375\npay items added to a Contract that result in a new contracting opportunity not reasonably related to existing pay items being performed by the Contractor or a subcontractor.   When significant extra work related to existing pay items being performed by a 380\nDBE subcontractor is added to a contract with a DBE goal, the Contractor shall offer that same DBE subcontractor the opportunity to perform the extra work whether or not the existing pay items are counted toward the DBE goal. The Contractor shall consider other DBE subcontractors if the extra work would result in the original DBE subcontractor exceeding its prequalification limits. The Department may consider an 385\nexception to a DBE subcontractor\u2019s prequalification limit. If the DBE subcontractor is\nunable to perform the extra work, the Contractor shall hire or make good faith efforts\nto hire an alternate DBE subcontractor to perform the work.   When significant extra work related to existing pay items being performed by a 390\nnon-DBE subcontractor is added to a contract with a DBE goal, the non-DBE subcontractor may perform the extra work. If the non-DBE subcontractor is unable to 103.01\n23 perform the extra work, the Contractor may self-perform the extra work. If the\nContractor chooses not to self-perform the extra work, the Contractor shall hire or make good faith efforts to hire a DBE firm to perform the work. 395\nWhen significant extra work related to existing pay items being performed by the\nContractor is added to a contract with a DBE goal, the Contractor may self-perform\nthe extra work. If the Contractor chooses not to self-perform the extra work, the Contractor shall hire or make good faith efforts to hire a DBE firm to perform the 400\nwork.   The Contractor shall forward documentation of good faith efforts to hire a DBE subcontractor to perform extra work to the District Equal Employment Opportunity Officer (EEO Officer) for review. The EEO Officer will determine if good faith efforts 405\nhave been met in accordance with 103.01(e)1.   If the EEO Officer determines that the Contractor failed to make good faith efforts to hire a DBE firm when required as a result of significant extra work, written notice\nwill be sent to the Contractor. The Contractor may appeal the determination in 410\naccordance with 103.01(e)1.    (f) Affirmative Action Certification\nThe Affirmative Action Certification, included in the Proposal, shall be completed when the Proposal is submitted to the Department. The certification shall list all DBE 415\nfirms the Contractor plans to utilize, either race/gender consciously or race/gender neutrally. Blank certifications shall cause the bid to be rejected. If a portion of a pay item is to be performed by a DBE, an explanation shall be included stating exactly what the DBE is performing or supplying. Failure to do so may affect the award of the contract. The Contractor shall ensure that DBE firms listed on the Affirmative Action 420\nCertification are certified DBE firms as listed in the Department\u2019s DBE directory at\nthe time of letting. In addition to the listing of DBE firms that will be used race/gender consciously to meet the goal, the Contractor shall also provide a total for the amount of work that it anticipates will be performed by other DBE firms used race/gender neutrally on the contract beyond the goal requirements. 425\nRace/gender neutral awards involve the utilization of a DBE firm because the DBE firm is the best firm to perform the work. Race/gender conscious awards involve the utilization of a DBE firm primarily to achieve the contract DBE goal.  430\n(g) Subcontracts\nIf the Contractor intends to subcontract a portion of the work, affirmative action\nshall be taken to seek out and consider DBEs as potential subcontractors prior to the\nsubcontractual commitment.  435\nThe contacts made with potential DBE subcontractors and the results thereof shall be documented and made available to the Department and the FHWA upon request.  103.01\n24  If the Contractor originally did not intend to subcontract a portion of the work and\nlater circumstances dictate subcontracting a portion of the work, the affirmative action 440\ncontacts described herein shall be performed.   Upon receipt of notification from the Department, a Disadvantaged Business\nEnterprise Utilization Affidavit, Form DBE-3, shall be completed by the Contractor\nand returned to the Department. The Contractor and the subcontractor/lessor/supplier 445\nshall certify on Form DBE-3 that specific amounts have been paid and received. A DBE-3 Form certification shall be completed and submitted for every DBE utilized on the contract, whether or not there was a DBE contract goal.\n\n(h) Leases and Rentals 450\nHauling leases made with DBEs shall be submitted to the Department for approval before beginning work. Leases for hauling, when used, shall be submitted when borrow, subbase, compacted aggregate, HMA mix, cement concrete mix, or a combination of the above is to be hauled by a DBE. The lease shall show the dollar amount of anticipated work before the work begins. The actual dollar amount shall be 455\nreported to the Department after the work has been completed.\nIn order to perform a commercially useful function on a contract, the dollar\nvolume of hauling by a DBE trucking firm that is counted toward the DBE goal is limited to the total value of transportation services provided by the DBE's own trucks; 460\nthe total value of transportation services a DBE lessee provides with its own trucks; and the total value of transportation services a non-DBE lessee provides with its own trucks, not to exceed the value of transportation services provided by DBE-owned trucks. In addition, DBE credit will also be given for any fee or commission the non-\nDBE lessee receives as a result of the lease arrangement for any additional non-DBE 465\ntrucks.   In order to count leased trucks toward the goal, the lease must indicate that the\nDBE has exclusive use of and control over the truck. This does not preclude the leased\ntruck from being used by others during the term of the lease with the consent of the 470\nDBE, so long as the lease gives the DBE absolute priority for use of the leased truck. Leased trucks must display the name and identification number of the DBE. The DBE must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire trucking operation for which it is responsible on a particular contract, and there cannot be a contrived arrangement for the purpose of meeting the DBE goals. 475\nThe Contractor shall provide the Engineer copies of any lease agreements between DBE trucking subcontractors and any DBE or non-DBE trucking firms or owner/operators that will be used to supplement the DBE trucking subcontractor\u2019s trucks for the purpose of meeting the DBE goal. Copies of these lease agreements shall 480\nbe provided by the time of use of any supplemental trucks on the Contract.\nIn addition to delivery ticket information required by Section 106, the name of trucking firm shall be included on each ticket for material delivered to the job site by a DBE trucking subcontractor or lessee. 485 103.01\n25\nThe Contractor shall notify the Department when purchases or rental of equipment, other than leases for hauling, are made with DBEs. The information submitted shall include the name of the business, the dollar amount of the transaction,\nthe type of purchase made, or the type of equipment rented. 490\n\nIf a subcontract agreement between the Contractor and a majority subcontractor requires that the majority subcontractor sublease a portion of its hauling to a DBE, the Contractor may receive credit toward the contract goal. The Contractor shall notify the\nDepartment when sublease agreements exist. The notification shall include the name 495\nof the DBE, the dollar amount of anticipated hauling before the work begins, and the actual dollar amount after the work is completed. The subcontractor shall certify actual utilization of the DBE at the end of the work and provide such certification to the Contractor for submission to the Department.  500\n(i) Records and Reports\nThe Contractor shall keep such records as necessary to determine compliance with\nits DBE utilization obligations and compliance with the Guidelines for Determining\nof Good Faith Efforts. The Contractor\u2019s records shall indicate the minimum\nrequirements as follows: 505\n1. The number of disadvantaged, non-minority, and women\nsubcontractors and suppliers and type and dollar value of work or materials services being performed on or incorporated into this contract. 510\n2. The progress and efforts being made in seeking out\ndisadvantaged contractor organizations and individual\ndisadvantaged contractors for work on this contract.\n515\n3. Documentation of all correspondence, contacts, or telephone\ncalls to obtain the services of DBEs on this contract.\nReports shall be submitted as required by the Department for those contracts and other business agreements executed with DBEs with respect to the records referred to 520\nabove.   All such records shall be maintained for a period of three years following acceptance of final payment and shall be available for inspection by the Department and the FHWA and their authorized representatives. 525\n\n103.02 Specific Equal Employment Opportunity Responsibilities  This requirement will apply only to a federal aid contract.\nThe Contractor and all subcontractors not including material suppliers, holding 530\nsubcontracts of $10,000.00 or more, shall comply with the following minimum 103.02\n26 specific requirement activities of equal employment opportunity. The equal\nemployment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, included in the Contract Information book, will be applicable to material suppliers as well as contractors and subcontractors. The Contractor shall include these requirements in 535\neach subcontract of $10,000.00 or more with such modification of language as\nnecessary to make them binding on the subcontractor.\n103.03 Record Keeping  All firms performing work on Department contracts, bidding on Department 540\ncontracts, or offering quotes for subcontract or trucking services shall register with the Department, annually, by submitting the following information to the Department\u2019s Prequalification Engineer:    (a) firm\u2019s name, 545\n(b) firm\u2019s address,\n(c) firm\u2019s status as a DBE or non-DBE,   (d) the age of the firm,\n(e) the annual gross receipts of the firm, and\n(f) identify which of the following markets the firm has participated: 550\n1. prime Contractor\n2. subcontractor    3. hauler    4. consultant 555\n5 .  s u p p l i e r .\n103.04 Blank\n103.05 Insurance 560\nPrior to commencing the work, the Contractor shall obtain and thereafter keep in force, the following insurance coverages provided by insurance companies acceptable to the Department and authorized to transact business under the laws of the State of Indiana.

    "text": "104.01 Intent of Contract  The intent of the contract is to provide for the construction and completion in every detail of the work described. 5\nThe Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, safety equipment, transportation, and supplies required to complete the work in accordance\nwith the plans, specifications, and terms of the contract.\n10\nIt is understood by all concerned that the apparent silence of the specifications as to a detail or the apparent omission of a detailed description concerning a point shall be regarded as meaning that only the best general practice is to prevail and that only material and workmanship of the first quality is to be used. All interpretations of these 103.08\n32 specifications shall be made on this basis. 15\nIn order to avoid cumbersome and confusing repetition of expressions in these specifications, it is provided that whenever any thing is, or is to be done, if, as, when, or where contemplated, required, determined, directed, specified, allowed, authorized,\nordered, given, designated, indicated, considered necessary, deemed necessary, 20\npermitted, reserved, suspended, established, approved, disapproved, acceptable, unacceptable, suitable, accepted, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, sufficient, rejected, or condemned, it shall be understood as if the expression was followed by the words \u201cby\nthe Engineer\u201d or \u201cto the Engineer\u201d.  25\nIt is further provided that all work including the furnishing of materials, equipment, tools, labor, and incidentals required to carry out the terms of the contract shall be done by the Contractor, its employees, or subcontractors unless specifically set out otherwise in the Proposal. The words \u201cby the Contractor\u201d will not necessarily be used to so indicate. All work shall be carried out in a thorough, careful, effective, 30\nand satisfactory manner without specifically using these words to describe the action.\n\nReports and other documents that are determined to be pertinent and necessary to the effective monitoring of the contract shall be submitted by all applicable contractors and subcontractors in accordance with appropriately issued instructions. 35\n104.02 Changed Conditions  A changed condition causes the work to substantially differ in kind or nature from the work as required in the original contract. The Department will adjust the contract for changed conditions as described herein. A contract adjustment may revise one or 40\nmore of the following:\n(a) the work to be performed\n(b) the time required for the work 45\n(c) the amount of compensation due the Contractor.   Changed conditions considered as reason for a contract adjustment are differing site conditions, suspensions of work ordered by the Engineer, and significant changes 50\nin the character of the work. A request by the Contractor for a contract adjustment shall be based on one or more of the changed conditions described herein.    (a) Differing Site Conditions\nDuring the progress of the work, if subsurface or latent physical conditions are 55\nencountered at the site differing materially from those indicated in the contract or if unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the contract, are encountered at the site, the party discovering such conditions shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the specific differing conditions before 60 104.02\n33 the site is disturbed and before the affected work is performed.\nUpon written notification, the Engineer w ill investigate th e conditions, and if it is\ndetermined that the conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any work under the contract, an 65\nadjustment, excluding anticipated profits, will be made and the contract modified in\nwriting accordingly. The Engineer will notify the Contractor of the determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted.   No contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed 70\nunless the Contractor has provided the required written notice of a changed condition in accordance with 105.16.   No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause for any effects caused on unchanged work. 75\n(b) Suspensions of Work Ordered by the Engineer\nIf the performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended or delayed by\nthe Engineer in writing for an unreasonable period of time (not originally anticipated, customary, or inherent to the construction industry) and the Contractor believes that 80\nadditional compensation, and/or contract time is due as a result of such suspension or delay, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer in writing a request for adjustment within seven calendar days of receipt of the notice to resume work. The request shall set forth the reasons and support for such adjustment.  85\nUpon receipt, the Engineer will evaluate the Contractor\u2019s request. If the Engineer agrees that the cost and/or time required for the performance of the contract has increased as a result of such suspension and the suspension was caused by conditions\nbeyond the control of and not the fault of the Contractor, its suppliers, or\nsubcontractors at any approved tier, and not caused by weather, the Engineer will make 90\nan adjustment (excluding prof it) and modify the contract  in writing ac cordingly. The\nContractor will be notified of the Engineer\u2019s determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted.   No contract adjustment will be allowed unless the Contractor has submitted the 95\nrequest for adjustment within the time prescribed in accordance with 105.16.   No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the extent that performance would have been suspended or delayed by any other cause, or for which an adjustment is provided or excluded under any other term or condition of this 100\ncontract.\n(c) Significant Changes in the Character of Work  The Engineer reserves the right to make, in writing, at any time during the work, such changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as are necessary to 105\nsatisfactorily complete the project. Such changes in quantities and alterations shall not 104.02\n34 invalidate the contract nor release the surety, and the Contractor agrees to perform the\nwork as altered.   If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the 110\nwork under the contract, whether such alterations or changes are in themselves\nsignificant changes to the character of the work or by affecting other work cause such\nother work to become significantly different in character, an adjustment, excluding anticipated profit, will be made to the contract. The basis for the adjustment shall be agreed upon prior to the performance of the work. If a basis cannot be agreed upon, 115\nthen an adjustment will be made either for or against the Contractor in such amount as the Engineer may determine to be fair and equitable.   If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the work to be performed under the contract, the altered work will be paid for as 120\nprovided elsewhere in the contract.   No contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed\nunless the Contractor has provided the required written notice of a changed condition\nin accordance with 105.16. 125\nThe term \u201csignificant change\u201d shall be construed to apply only to the following circumstances:     1. When the character of the work as altered differs materially in 130\nkind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed construction; or\n2. When a major item of work, as defined elsewhere in the\ncontract, is increased in excess of 125% or decreased below 135\n75% of the original contract quantity. Any allowance for an increase in quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of 125% of the original contract item quantity, or in case of a decrease below 75%, to the actual amount of work performed.\n140\n(d) Pre-established Remedies to Changed Conditions\nThe Contractor and the Department shall cooperatively work to resolve a request\nfor a contract adjustment due to a changed condition by means of the pre-established remedies described herein.\n145\nAfter receipt of a notice of a changed condition in accordance with 105.16, the\nEngineer will determine if the Contractor\u2019s request for a contract adjustment is\njustified. The Engineer will respond to the Contractor in writing within two business\ndays of the receipt of notification, or other time as mutually agreed, as to whether the request is justified and as to how the changed condition will be remedied. 150\nIf the Engineer determines that a request for a contract adjustment is justified, the 104.02\n35 changed condition will be remedied by means of a contract adjustment based on one\nor more of the following pre-established remedies.\n155\n1. Calculations and payment involving existing pay items in the\ncontract.\n2. Payment for extra work in accordance with 104.03.\n160\n3. Extension of contract time in accordance with 108.08.\n4. Payment for delay costs in accordance with 109.05.2 as allowed\nby 108.08(b).\n165\nIf the impact of a changed condition will not be known for some length of time, the following procedure shall be followed to expedite a contract adjustment until the\nimpact of the change can be determined.\n1. After submitting notification of the changed condition, the 170\nContractor shall keep daily records, apart from other records, of all labor, material, and equipment costs incurred for the work affected. The daily records shall identify each operation affected and the location where work is affected.\n175\n2. The Engineer will also maintain daily records of the work\naffected from the date of the notification.\n3. Beginning the week following notification of a changed\ncondition, the Contractor shall meet weekly with the Engineer 180\nto exchange and discuss each party\u2019s daily records of the work\naffected during the preceding week.\n4. The Contractor shall notify the Engineer in writing within three\nbusiness days of any disagreements with the Engineer\u2019s records 185\nand include the specific points of disagreement. These points will be addressed by the Engineer at the next weekly meeting.\n5. Refusal by the Contractor to attend any weekly meeting or to\nsubmit daily records at a weekly meeting will constitute a 190\nwaiver to any objections to the accuracy of the Engineer\u2019s records and the Engineer\u2019s records will control for purposes of\ncomputing any contract adjustment for the changed condition.\nIf the Contractor accepts the Engineer\u2019s remedy for a changed condition, the 195\ncontract adjustment will be considered to be full and complete compensation for the changed condition and no further contract adjustment will be made for the circumstances of the Contractor\u2019s request. 104.02\n36\nIf the Contractor disagrees with the Engineer\u2019s remedy for a changed condition, 200\nand decides to further pursue compensation, a written notification of a claim may be submitted in accordance with 105.16.\nPre-established remedies to a changed condition have the following conditions.\n205\n1. Acceleration  If the Department gives written direction for the Contractor to accelerate the work, a contract adjustment will be made specifying the work to be accelerated, the time to be saved by acceleration and the amount of compensation due the Contractor for the acceleration. 210\nThe Department assumes no liability for constructive acceleration unless the Contractor has provided written notice of the intent to accelerate the work, there is an excusable delay for which the Department has either improperly rejected the Contractor's request for an extension of contract time or failed to act on the request, 215\nand the Contractor has incurred additional costs for the acceleration.\n2. Inefficiencies\nIf a claimed loss of productivity due to a changed condition cannot be isolated and remedied separately, the Department will consider payment for inefficiency costs on 220\nthe basis of a measured mile analysis performed by the Contractor or other analysis method approved by the Engineer.   If the claimed inefficiency is for work performed out of scheduled sequence due to the changed condition, the current accepted schedule will be analyzed to determine 225\nif the work was performed out of sequence.\n\n3. Unrecoverable Costs\nThe Department will not make payment for any of the following:\n230\na. Loss of anticipated profits.      b. Consequential damages, including but not limited to\nloss of bonding capacity, loss of bidding opportunities and insolvency. 235\nc. Expense of claim preparation and submission,\nincluding but not limited to attorney\u2019s fees, consultant\u2019s\nfees and expenses and litigation expenses.\n240\nd. Interest.\ne. Home office overhead in excess of that provided for in\nthe contract. 104.02\n37  245\n4. Unacceptable Cost Calculation Methods  The Department will not make any payments for costs calculated using any of the following methods:\na. Total cost methods based on calculation of costs as the 250\ndifference between the Contractor\u2019s bid for the work and the Contractor\u2019s calculation of the costs for the work.\nb. Calculation of home office overhead using the Eichleay 255\nFormula or other formulas used to calculate home office overhead due to delay.\n104.03 Extra Work  Unforeseen work, for which there is no price included in the contract, shall be 260\nperformed whenever it is deemed necessary to fully complete the contract within its\nintended scope, or it is in the best interest of the State to complete the unforeseen work\nunder the contract. Such work shall be performed in accordance with the specifications and as directed, and will be paid for in accordance with 109.05.  265\n104.04 Maintenance of Traffic\nUnless otherwise provided, the road shall be kept open to all traffic while undergoing improvements. Where so provided on the plans, the traffic may be bypassed over an approved detour route. The detour route markings shall be erected, maintained, and removed by the Contractor. 270\nMaintenance of traffic shall be in accordance with the details as shown on the\nplans or as directed. If an alternate plan for maintaining traffic is requested, it shall be\nsubmitted in writing as soon as possible for consideration. Such submittal shall include the complete details of the alternate maintenance of traffic scheme including all traffic 275\ncontrol devices to be incorporated. If approved, the alternate plan shall not increase the cost of maintaining traffic to the Department.   The portion of the roadway being used by public traffic shall be kept in a condition\nwhich allows traffic to be adequately accommodated. Drums in accordance with 280\n801.09 shall be placed at 200 ft intervals where drop-offs of greater than 3 in. are adjacent to the shoulder until the aggregate or earth wedge is placed.

In this event, the basis of acceptance\nwill be documented by an appropr iate adjustment in the contract price for such work 100\nor materials as deemed necessary to conform to the determination based on engineering judgment.\nIf the Engineer finds the materials or the finished product in which the materials are used or the work performed are not in reasonably close conformance with the plans 105\nand specifications and have resulted in an inferior or unsatisfactory product, the work or materials shall be removed and replaced or otherwise corrected with no additional payment.\n\n105.04 Coordination of Plans, Standard Specifications, and Special 110\nProvisions  The Standard Specifications, the plans, special provisions, and all supplementary\ndocuments are essential parts of the contract. A requirement occurring in one is as\nbinding as though occurring in all. They are intended to be complementary and to describe and provide for a complete work. In case of discrepancy, calculated 115\ndimensions will govern over scaled dimensions; and the following relationships apply:  105.04\n47 Instructions to Bidders and\ndescription of pay items listed\nin the Schedule of Pay Items\n\nhold over:\n\nQuestion and Answer Form Unique Special Provisions\nPlans Recurring Special Provisions\nStandard Specifications\n\nQuestion and Answer Form holds over: Unique Special Provisions\nPlans\nRecurring Special Provisions Standard Specifications\n\nUnique Special Provisions hold over: Plans\nRecurring Special Provisions Standard Specifications\nPlans hold over: Recurring Special Provisions\nStandard Specifications\nRecurrin g Special Provisions hold over: Standard Specifications\n\nThe Contract pre-bid Question and Answer Forms published on the Department's 120\nContract Letting Information website are a part of the Contract Letting Documents. In\ncase of discrepancy relative to other contract documents, the Question and Answer\nForms shall take precedence over Unique Special Provisions. In case of discrepancy\nrelative to other contract documents, the QPL will be regarded the same as Recurring Special Provisions. Notes on the plans which are not also included in either the special 125\nprovisions or among the general notes portion of the plans, and refer to payment, non-payment, or cost to be included in that of other pay items, will not govern over specifications. The precedence outlined herein shall not absolve the Contractor of its responsibility in accordance with 107.17.  130\nAdvantage shall not be taken of any apparent error or omission in the plans or specifications. In the event such an error or omission is discovered, the Engineer shall\nbe notified immediately. Such corrections and interpretations as may be deemed\nnecessary for fulfilling the intent of the plans and specifications will then be made.  135\n105.05 Cooperation by Contractor\nThe Department will furnish the Contractor all contract documents in electronic format without charge. The Contractor shall be responsible for supplying all necessary information for use by contractor and subcontractor personnel.  140\nThe work shall be given the constant attention necessary to facilitate the progress thereof. The Contractor shall cooperate with the Engineer, technicians, inspectors, and 105.05\n48 other contractors in every way possible.\nWhere new work is to be fitted to old work, the Contractor shall check all 145\ndimensions and conditions in the field prior to ordering material and assume responsibility for fit of new work to old.\n\nThe Contractor shall have available at all times, and on the work site when work is in progress, as its agent, a competent superintendent capable of reading and 150\nunderstanding the plans and specifications and experienced in the type of work being performed.

In an effort to prevent these pests from being spread by shipments of infested materials, quarantines have been imposed. Under the regulations, materials and equipment that may be infested must be treated before they 20\nare moved from an infested area. Such items as hay, straw, fodder, small grains, corn,\nsod, earth moving equipment, and other articles that might be infested are subject to\nthese regulations. All State, Federal, and local regulations and quarantines pertaining thereto shall be observed. No additional allowance or compensation will be made for any delay or inconvenience incurred conforming to such requirements, but the cost 25\nthereof shall be included in the various pay items.   It shall be a condition of each contract let for the construction of a State maintained highway or bridge, financed entirely with state funds that all unskilled laborers employed on such work shall be residents of the county or counties in which 30\nsuch highway or bridge is being constructed, if such labor is available.

Parties bearing such permits, and only those 120\nparties, will be allowed to perform work on the right-of-way.\n107.05 Federal Aid Provisions\nWhen the United States Government pays all or a portion of the cost of a project, the Federal laws and the rules and regulations made pursuant to such laws shall be 125\nobserved. The work shall be subject to inspection by the appropriate Federal agency.\nSuch inspection will in no sense make the Federal Government a party to the contract and will in no way interfere with the rights of any party.   The U.S. Department of Labor has designated the Administrator of the Wage and 130\nHour and Public Contracts Division to conduct investigations with the compliance and 107.05\n73 enforcement of labor standards. However, the administration and enforcement of labor\nstandards remain the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Transportation.   107.06 Equal Employment Opportunity Trainees 135\nEqual Employment Opportunity trainees will be required if the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Trainees hours are shown in the Proposal. The number of\ntrainees required will be one trainee for each 1,000 h shown.   When the project is funded in total or in part by the United States Government 140\nand no Equal Employment Opportunity hours are shown in the Proposal, the Contractor shall participate in the Department\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Trainee Program. Requirements for participation in the program are available on the Department\u2019s website or from the Department\u2019s Equal Opportunity Division. Failure by the Contractor to comply with this requirement may result in reduction or loss of 145\nprequalification to bid for future work.   As part of the Contractor\u2019s equal opportunity affirmative action program, training\nshall be provided as on-the-job training aimed at developing full journeymen in the\ntype of trade or job classification involved. 150\nIf the Contractor subcontracts a portion of the work, it shall determine as to how many, if any, of the trainees are to be trained by the subcontractors, provided, however, that the Contractor shall retain the primary responsibility for meeting the training requirements imposed herein. The Contractor shall also ensure that these requirements 155\nare made applicable to such subcontract. Where feasible, 25% of apprentices or trainees in each occupation shall be in their first year of apprenticeship or training.   The trainees shall be distributed among the work classifications on the basis of\nthe Contractor\u2019s needs and the availability of journeymen in the various classifications 160\nwithin a reasonable area of recruitment. Prior to commencing construction, the Contractor shall submit to the Department for approval the number of trainees to be trained in each selected classification and training program to be used. Furthermore, the Contractor shall specify the starting time for training in each of the classifications. The Contractor will be credited for each trainee employed on the contract work that is 165\ncurrently enrolled or becomes enrolled in an approved program.   Training and upgrading of minorities and women toward journeymen status is the primary objective. Accordingly, the Contractor shall make every effort to enroll minority and women trainees, for example, by conducting systematic and direct 170\nrecruitment through public and private sources likely to yield such minority and\nwomen trainees to the extent that such persons are available within a reasonable area\nof recruitment. The Contractor will be responsible for demonstrating the steps taken in pursuance thereof, prior to a determination as to whether the Contractor is in compliance with this provision. This training commitment is not intended, and shall 175\nnot be used, to discriminate against an applicant for training, whether a member of a minority group or not.\n107.06\n74  No employee shall be employed as a trainee in a classification in which he or she\nhas successfully completed a training course leading to journeyman status or in which 180\nhe or she has been employed as a journeyman. The Contractor shall satisfy this requirement by including appropriate questions in the employee application or by other suitable means. Regardless of the method used, the Contractor\u2019s records shall\ndocument its findings in each case.\n185\nThe minimum length and type of training for each classification will be as established in the training program selected by the Contractor and approved by the Department. The Department and the FHWA will approve a program if it is reasonably calculated to meet the equal employment opportunity obligations of the Contractor and to qualify the requirement for journeyman status in the classification concerned by the 190\nend of the training period. Furthermore, apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or with a State apprenticeship agency recognized by such Bureau, and training programs approved but not necessarily sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training shall also be considered 195\nacceptable provided they are being administered in a manner consistent with the equal\nemployment obligations of the contract. Approval or acceptance of a training program shall be obtained from the State prior to commencing work on the classification covered by the program. Training shall be provided in the construction crafts rather than clerk-typists or secretarial-type positions. Training programs for other than 200\ntraditional training programs may be submitted for consideration where the training is oriented toward construction applications. Training in the laborer classification may be allowed provided that significant and meaningful training is provided and approved by the Department. Some offsite training is allowable as long as the training is an integral part of an approved training program and does not comprise a significant part 205\nof the overall training.\n\nIt is normally expected that a trainee shall begin his or her training on the project as soon as feasible after start of work utilizing the skill involved and shall remain on the project as long as training opportunities exist in his or her work classification or 210\nuntil he or she has completed the training program. It is not required that all trainees be on board for the entire contract time. The Contractor shall have fulfilled its responsibilities if it has provided acceptable training to the number of trainees specified. The number trained shall be determined on the basis of the total number enrolled on the contract for a significant period. 215\nTrainees will be paid at least 60% of the appropriate minimum journeyman\u2019s rate paid by the Contractor for the first half of the training period, 75% for the third quarter\nof the training period, and 90% for the last quarter of the training period, unless\napprentices or trainees in an approved existing program are enrolled as trainees on the 220\nproject. In that case, the appropriate rates approved by the United States Department of Labor or Transportation in connection with the existing program shall apply to all trainees being trained for the same classification who are covered by this specification. However, the salary shall never be less than specified in IC 8-23-9-22. 107.06\n75  225\nThe trainee shall be furnished a copy of the program to be followed in providing the training. Each trainee shall be provided with a certification showing the type and length of training satisfactorily completed.\nThe maintenance of records and the furnishing of periodic reports documenting 230\nits performance shall be in accordance with these requirements.   107.07 Sanitary Conditions Requirements  Accommodations for the use of employees shall be provided and maintained in a neat and sanitary condition as may be necessary to comply with the requirements of 235\nthe Federal, State, and local Boards of Health, or of other bodies or tribunals having jurisdiction.   107.08 Public Convenience and Safety  All safeguards, safety devices, and protective equipment shall be provided. 240\nResponsibility reasonably necessary to protect the lives of employees on the job, the\nsafety of the public, and property in connection with the performance of the work,\nshall be taken.    (a) Worker Safety 245\nAll workers within the right-of-way who are exposed either to traffic or construction equipment within the work area shall wear high visibility safety apparel in accordance with Section 6D.03 of the MUTCD.   If a trench, 5 ft or more in depth, is constructed on a project, the requirements for 250\ntrench safety systems as specified in OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1926, Subpart P, shall be performed. Unless otherwise specified, trench safety systems work will not be paid\nfor separately, but the cost thereof shall be included in the cost of the pay item covering\nthe trench excavation work.  255\n(b) Dust and Air Pollution  Provision shall be made for prompt removal from traveled roadways of all dirt and other materials that have been deposited thereon by operations concerned with the project whenever the accumulation is sufficient to cause the formation of dust or mud, interfere with drainage, damage pavements, or create a traffic hazard. Construction 260\nmethods and means shall be employed to keep flying dust and air pollution to a minimum. Provision shall be made for the control of dust on the project and on roads, streets, and other areas affected by the project wherever traffic or buildings, or construction materials are affected by such dust. The materials and methods used for\ndust control shall be subject to approval. The cost of controlling dust and air pollution 265\nshall be included in the cost of other pay items and no additional payment will be made.    (c) Protection to Traffic\nThe work shall be arranged so that all operations on the pavement will be held to 270 107.07\n76 a minimum by using the new grade insofar as possible. The work shall be conducted\nin a manner that will ensure the least obstruction to traffic. Materials stored on the right-of-way shall be placed so as to cause only such inconvenience to the traveling\npublic and residents as is considered unavoidable.   275\nNon-operating construction equipment, worker\u2019s vehicles, materials, field offices,\nfield laboratories, and temporary offices may be stored on the right-of-way no less than 30 ft from the edge of pavement lanes open to traffic except, storage may be allowed closer to such lanes if traffic is protected by guardrail in good condition or other suitable barrier. However, if the area has a posted speed limit of 40 mph or less 280\nprior to the start of construction, this distance may be reduced to 10 ft, if approved.   Temporary crossings and approaches in passable condition shall be provided and maintained as shown on the plans and in accordance with 104.04, with no additional payment. 285\n(d) Notice to Local Public Officials\nOn construction work, the chief administrative officer of the local governmental\nunit shall be given 24 h notice, in writing, before it becomes necessary to blockade a cross street. 290\nIf it is desired to use water from public hydrants, application shall be made to the proper authorities and in accordance with the city ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning their use. Fire hydrants shall be accessible at all times to the fire department. No material or other obstruction shall be placed closer to a fire hydrant 295\nthan specified by ordinances, rules, or regulations, or within 5 ft of a fire hydrant in the absence of such ordinances, rules, or regulations.\nThe local governmental agencies for each jurisdiction in the State have the legal\nauthority to establish load limits on their roads. Prior to submitting a bid, each bidder 300\nshall contact the local governmental agency in which the use of roads is contemplated and confirm allowable routing of bidder\u2019s equipment.    (e) Convenience to Traffic and Property Owners\nFrontage roads, public roads, and private and mailbox approaches which are 305\ndisturbed shall be reconstructed as soon as possible to avoid unreasonable inconvenience to traffic and adjacent property owners.   The grading of all approaches and frontage roads shall be completed and the drainage structures shall be placed concurrently with the roadway excavation and 310\nembankment construction, except as directed or specified. It is the general intent to\nconstruct frontage roads, public roads, and private drive approaches, including at least the grading, structures, and base course, as soon as possible to minimize inconvenience to the abutting property owners when their access to existing outlets is being cut off\nby the construction. 315\n107.08\n77  If postponement of the above construction causes unreasonable inconvenience to\ntraffic and adjacent property owners, the Contractor shall construct an adequate, approved, temporary surface on all such frontage roads, public roads, and private approaches with no additional payment. All cost thereof shall be considered as 320\nincluded in the various pay items of the contract.\n\nIf the contract involves widening, one-lane traffic shall be maintained across all\npublic, private, and commercial approaches either by leaving gaps in the widening or by use of temporary crossing bridges. 325\n107.09 Railroad-Highway Requirements\nWhenever it is necessary or required for personnel or construction equipment to be on operating railroad right-of-way, all necessary arrangements shall be made with the railroad company regarding a temporary or existing railroad grade crossing for this 330\npurpose. Such railroad grade crossing shall be in accordance with these specifications and shall meet all requirements of the railroad company. All cost involved in establishing the crossing shall be included in the contract price for various pay items\nand will not be paid for directly.\n335\nAll work on the railroad right-of-way shall be performed at such times and so as not to interfere unnecessarily with the movement of trains or traffic upon the tracks of the railroad company. All care and precautions shall be used in order to avoid accidents, damage, or unnecessary delay or interference with the trains or other property of the railroad company. 340\nWhen necessary, adjacent structures, embankments, and tracks of the railroad company shall be protected and shored adequately. The Contractor shall assume all risks and liability for damage done to such property as a result of its operations or\nnegligence. No method of work which affects the tracks, movement of trains, or other 345\noperations of the railroad shall be used without the approval of the railroad company.   When bridge deck work is being performed over railroad property, including tracks and wires, and the bridge floor slab is penetrated, the work shall be stopped in the area of the penetration. Both the Engineer and the railroad company shall be 350\nnotified. The railroad property shall be protected as approved before resuming work.    (a) Protection of Track Ballast\nOperations shall be conducted both on and off railroad right-of-way so that earth, mud, silt, or other foreign matter shall not be allowed to foul railroad track ballast. 355\nTemporary earth dikes, sheeting, tie cribbing, silt fences, or other precautions to\nprevent the fouling of railroad track ballast shall be installed as directed.\nWhere demolition work, concreting, or hauling along or across tracks, in the opinion of the railroad company, will result in ballast becoming fouled, preventive 360\nmeasures shall be taken to protect the entire ballast section. This may be accomplished by nailing canvas, plywood, or similar material to the ties in the entire area likely to 107.09\n78 be affected. This protective material shall remain in place until there is no further\npossibility of fouling the ballast. At that time, it shall be removed.  365\nThese protective measures shall be performed with no additional payment under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the chief engineer of the railroad company or\nits authorized representative. The railroad company will assume no responsibility for\nthe adequacy of the protective measures. However, in addition to the aforementioned protective measures, if the railroad track ballast does become fouled, the railroad 370\ncompany, with its own forces, will remove the fouled ballast and replace it with clean ballast. The charges for this work will be billed by the railroad company against the Contractor.    (b) Hold Harmless Clause 375\nThe Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless the Railroad Company and the State from all suits, actions, or claims of any character brought for or on account of any injuries or damages received or sustained by any person, persons or property from the acts of the Contractor or its forces, or in consequence of any neglect in\nsafeguarding the work, or on account of any claims or amounts recovered for any 380\nmaterial furnished or labor performed, or for any infringement of patent, trademark or copyright, or any claims arising or amount recovered under the Worker\u2019s Compensation Laws, Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act, or under any other laws, by-laws, ordinances, orders or decrees.  385\n107.10 Archeological Artifacts\nIf archeological artifacts, including cultural features or skeletal remains are discovered, all work within a minimum 100 ft radius of the discovery shall cease immediately, the area shall not be further disturbed, and the Contractor shall notify the Engineer immediately. 390\n\nIn accordance with IC 14-21-1-27, if skeletal remains are encountered, the\nContractor shall notify the local law enforcement agency immediately and the\nEngineer immediately thereafter.

The Contractor\u2019s employees and subcontractors shall be required, both independently and at the request of forest officials, to do all reasonably within their power to prevent and 560\nsuppress and to assist in preventing and suppressing forest fires and to make every possible effort to notify a forest official at the earliest possible moment of the location and extent of all fires seen by them.\n107.17 Responsibility for Damage Claims 565\nThe Contractor shall indemnify, defend, exculpate, and hold harmless the State of Indiana, its officials and employees from all liability due to loss, damage, injuries, or other casualties of whatsoever kind, or by whomsoever caused, to the person or property of anyone on or off the right-of-way arising out of or resulting from the performance of the contract or from the installation, existence, use, maintenance, 570\ncondition, repairs, alteration, or removal of any equipment or material, whether due in whole or in part to the negligent acts or omissions:\n(a) of the State, its officials, agents, or employees;  575\n(b) of the Contractor, its agents or employees, or other persons\nengaged in the performance of the contract;\n(c) the joint negligence of any of them, including any claim\narising out of the Worker\u2019s Compensation law or any other 580\nlaw, ordinance, order, or decree.\nThe Contractor also agrees to pay all reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees incurred by or imposed on the State in connection herewith in the event that the Contractor shall default under the provisions of this section. As much of the money 585\ndue the Contractor under and by virtue of its contract as the Department may consider necessary for such purpose may be retained for the use of the State. If no money is\ndue, the Contractor\u2019s surety may be held until such suit or suits, action or actions,\nclaim or claims for injuries or damages as aforesaid shall have been settled and suitable evidence to that effect furnished to the Department. Money due will not be withheld 590\nwhen the Contractor produces satisfactory evidence that it is protected adequately by public liability and property damage insurance. The obligation of the Contractor under this section and 107.01 shall not extend to the indemnification or exculpation against 107.17\n83 claims arising out of the preparation or approval of plans, specifications, or special\nprovisions unless furnished by the Contractor. 595\nIt is specifically agreed between the parties executing the contract that it is not intended by the provisions of any part of the contract to create the public or any\nmember thereof a third party beneficiary hereunder, or to authorize anyone not a party\nto the contract to maintain a suit for personal injuries or property damage pursuant to 600\nthe terms or provisions of the contract.   107.18 Opening Sections of Project to Traffic  Shoulders shall be graded and shaped to assure reasonable safety to traffic before opening any completed pavement to traffic. 605\nWork which is in suitable condition for travel, or any portion thereof, shall be opened to traffic as directed. Such opening shall not be construed as acceptance of the work or any part thereof, or as a waiver of any of the provisions of the contract.  610\nWhen it is desirable to open a structure or portion of a highway to traffic, such\nopening shall be delayed until traffic will cause no injury to completed portions of the work. When opening to traffic is required or allowed, the Contractor shall make provisions for the safety of the public as specified or directed. Opening to traffic will not relieve the Contractor of liability and responsibility prior to final acceptance. 615\nWhen a contract time has expired, the Contractor shall be responsible for all damage resulting from traffic and any other cause occurring on the incomplete portions of the project, whether these portions have been opened to traffic by order of the Department or not. 620\n\nOn those portions of an incomplete contract that have been ordered opened to\ntraffic or are constructed under traffic and the contract time has not yet expired, the Department will assume the responsibility for repairs of damages resulting directly from traffic, provided such damage is not the direct or indirect result of the operations 625\nof the Contractor and provided the Contractor is unable to collect damages from the responsible party or parties.   The Department will only assume such responsibility\n630\n(a) if the Contractor documents those damages with all\navailable information, including but not limited to photos and investigative materials, and\n\n(b) if the Contractor preserves all documentation, evidence, 635\nphotos and information regarding the nature, extent and cause of such damage.\nAlso, the Department will only assume such responsibility if, within 90 days from 107.18\n84 the date such damage is discovered by the Contractor or the Contractor receives notice 640\nof that damage, whichever is earlier,    (a) the Contractor demonstrates to the Department that despite its\ngood faith, vigorous efforts, it has been unable to collect those\ndamages from the responsible party or parties, and 645\n(b) the Contractor provides to the Department all documentation,\nevidence, photos and information regarding the nature, extent and cause of such damage.\n650\nOrdered repairs for damage for which the Department assumes responsibility will be paid for at the contract unit price for the item involved in making the repairs, where such items are applicable.   Opening a portion of a project to traffic does not preclude the responsibility of the 655\nContractor for providing necessary safety measures, as required in these Standard\nSpecifications, to protect persons using the highway.\n107.19 Contractor\u2019s Responsibility for Work\nUntil the date the Contractor is relieved of further maintenance as stated in the 660\nfinal written acceptance of the project, or portion thereof in accordance with 105.15, the Contractor shall have the charge and care thereof.

The Contractor shall coordinate and cooperate with the owners of all underground 685 107.20\n85 or overhead utility lines in their removal and relocation operations in order that this\nwork may progress in a reasonable manner, that duplication of relocation work may be reduced to a minimum, and that services rendered by those parties are not unnecessarily interrupted.  690\nIf it is necessary to place pipes or conduits through structures, sheet metal sleeves\nshall be provided around the pipe or conduit to make a sliding joint or provide suitable openings as required, with no additional payment.   If there is an interruption to water or utility services as a result of accidental 695\nbreakage or as a result of being exposed or unsupported, the Contractor shall promptly notify the proper authority, and shall cooperate with the said authority in the restoration of service. If water service is interrupted, repair work shall be continuous until the service is restored.

Regardless of previous notification by the Department, the Contractor shall give notice to the owners of each utility located within the contract limits, or which might be affected by the work, in sufficient time before beginning work for the owners to 710\nrelocate or protect their property. No work shall be done which injures or damages such property until satisfactory arrangements have been completed with the owner for its protection, relocation, or reconstruction.\n\nPrior to any work which penetrates any existing soil or pavement surface, the 715\nContractor shall notify both the Indiana Underground Plant Protection Service, IUPPS, in accordance with IC 8-1-26 requirements, and the Engineer in accordance with\n105.08 prior to commencing construction operations in an area that may affect underground utilities.  720\nIf abandoned underground utilities are encountered during construction, sections of which are to be removed, ends of pipes that remain in place shall be sealed with\nClass A concrete as directed. Concrete used for this purpose will be paid for at the contract unit price per cubic yard for concrete, A, in structures. Cutting of abandoned gas lines shall be by mechanical methods. A cutting torch shall not be used. 725\n\nIf a permit is issued to a city or other governmental unit for the installation of conduits, poles, or other appurtenances for artificial lighting of the structure, it may be necessary or desirable to revise the plans or make structural changes as needed to accommodate such installation. In this event, the provisions of 104.02 shall apply to 730\nall changes in quantities of work. 107.20\n86\n107.21 Furnishing Right-of-Way\nThe Department will be responsible for securing necessary right-of-way in advance of construction. Exceptions will be indicated in the contract. 735\n\n107.22 Personal Liability of Public Officials\nIn carrying out any of the provisions of these specifications, or in exercising any power or authority granted to them by or within the scope of the contract, there shall be no liability upon the Department, Commissioner, Engineer, or their authorized 740\nrepresentatives, either personally or as officials of the State, it being understood that in all such matters they act solely as agents and representatives of the State.   107.23 Waiver of Legal Rights\nUpon completion of the work, the Department will expeditiously make final 745\ninspection and notification of acceptance. Such final acceptance, however, shall not preclude or estop the Department from correcting any measurement, estimate, or certificate made before or after completion of the work, nor shall the Department be\nprecluded or estopped from recovering from the Contractor or its surety, or both, such\noverpayment as it may sustain by failure on the part of the Contractor to fulfill its 750\nobligations under the contract. A waiver on the part of the Department of any breach of any part of the contract shall not be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.   The Contractor, without prejudice to the terms of the contract, shall be liable to 755\nthe Department for latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as may amount to fraud, or with regard to the rights of the Department under any warranty or guaranty.   107.24 Governing Law\nThis contract shall be construed by the laws of the State of Indiana. Suit, if any, 760\nshall be brought in the State of Indiana.   107.25 Severability\nThe invalidity in whole or in part of a provision of the contract shall not void or affect the validity of all other provisions. 765"

For a completion date contract, unless otherwise\ndetermined, an increase in quantities will not increase\nthe time specified for the performance of the contract. 340\n\n2. If intermediate completion times are specified, unless\notherwise determined, an increase in quantities will not increase the time specified.\n345\nIf an intermediate completion time is specified for\nroad closure or restriction, the first day or portion thereof of the closure or restriction will constitute the first chargeable day. The date the road is opened to unrestricted traffic will be counted as a chargeable 350\nday, regardless of the time of day when the roadway is\nopened. Open to unrestricted traffic shall be as defined in 101.36. Temporary pavement marking materials in accordance with 801.12 shall be placed if the final marking materials cannot be placed in accordance with 355\n808.07(b).\nIf the Contractor finds it impossible for reasons beyond its control to complete the work within the contract time as specified prior to the expiration of the contract time, a written request in accordance with 105.16 may be made for an extension of time 360\nsetting forth therein the reasons which will justify the granting of the request. A plea\nthat insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for extension of time. If the\nEngineer finds that the contract controlling operation was delayed due to an excusable delay under 108.08(a) or 108.08(b), the Department will extend the contract time for completion in such amount as the conditions justify. The extended time for completion 365\nshall then be in full force and effect, the same as though it were the original time for completion. The Department will not extend contract time for a non-excusable delay under 108.08(c).   Contractors shall not work during the following holiday periods unless prior 370\nwritten approval is received from the Engineer. All deliveries and traffic coming from suppliers shall cease during the Department-ordered suspensions of work listed below.\nNo time extensions to closure periods, intermediate completion dates, or contract\ncompletion dates will be granted for suspending work during these holiday periods.\n375\n1. New Year\u2019s Day. If New Year\u2019s Day falls on a\nSunday, work shall be suspended from noon December 31 until sunrise January 3. If New Year\u2019s Day falls on a Monday through Saturday, work shall 108.08\n95 be suspended from noon December 31 until sunrise 380\nJanuary 2.\n\n2. Good Friday. Work shall be suspended from noon on\nGood Friday until sunrise Monday.\n385\n3. Memorial Day. Work shall be suspended from noon\nthe Friday before Memorial Day until sunrise Tuesday, the day after Memorial Day.\n\n4. Independence Day. If Independence Day falls on a: 390\nSunday - Work shall be suspended from noon Friday, July\n2, until sunrise Tuesday, July 6.\nMonday - Work shall be suspended from noon Friday, July 395\n1, until sunrise Tuesday, July 5.\nTuesday - Work shall be suspended from noon Friday, June\n30, until sunrise Wednesday, July 5.\n400\nWednesday - Work shall be suspended from sunset on\nTuesday, July 3, until sunrise Thursday, July 5.\nThursday - Work shall be suspended from noon\nWednesday, July 3, until sunrise Monday, July 8. 405\nFriday - Work shall be suspended from noon Thursday,\nJuly 3, until sunrise Monday, July 7.\nSaturday - Work shall be suspended from noon Thursday, 410\nJuly 2, until sunrise Monday, July 6.\n\n5. Labor Day. Work shall be suspended from noon the\nFriday before Labor Day until sunrise Tuesday, the day after Labor Day. 415\n\n6. Thanksgiving Day. Work shall be suspended from\nnoon the Wednesday before Thanksgiving Day until sunrise the Monday after Thanksgiving Day.\n420\n7. Christmas Day. Work shall be suspended from noon\nDecember 24 until sunrise December 27.\nThe Department may order the suspension of work, either wholly or in part, for a period of time for certain holidays not already specified herein. For such orders, if the 425 108.08\n96 contract suspension is not stated in the contract documents, the contract completion\ntime will be adjusted as follows:\n\n1. If a contract time is on a calendar day basis, all\ncalendar days on which work on the controlling 430\noperation is suspended will be excluded.\n\n2. If a contract time is a fixed calendar date, the contract\ntime will be extended by the number of days that work on the controlling operation is suspended. 435\n\nIf the Department does not specify nor order the suspension of work for certain\nholidays, work may be performed on those holidays. On a completion date contract, the contract completion time will not be shortened by the number of holidays worked.  440\nLiquidated damages will not be assessed during the required cure period for\nconcrete surfaces requiring a sealer, provided all other contract work is completed and\nall lanes are open to traffic. Liquidated damages will resume after the required cure\nperiod.   445\nIf an extension of time on a calendar day contract or a calendar completion date\ncontract extends the completion date past November 30, the days remaining after November 30 will be added to April 1, of the following year for the contract completion date, providing the project could be suitably opened to traffic in accordance with 107.18. 450\nCompletion of the removal of houses and buildings on time, if specified, shall be\nin accordance with the requirements herein.\n\nNot all parcels shown in the Schedule of Pay Items will be available for demolition 455\nat the time of the letting. Houses and buildings shall be removed as soon as they are vacated in accordance with the procedure as follows:\n1. The 15 calendar days limitation after the date of notice\nto proceed as specified in 108.03 will not apply. 460\n\n2. The contract time extension consideration for 30 days\ndelay in issuing the notice to proceed as specified in 108.08 will not apply to a contract for which demolition is the majority of the contract work. 465\n\n3. When parcels become available for demolition, the\nEngineer will notify the Contractor of the availability of such parcels. The Contractor shall commence work within five calendar days from the date of receipt of 470\nsuch notification. Inspection and testing for asbestos 108.08\n97 presence or filing a notification of demolition with the\nIDEM will be considered as part of the work.\n\n4. If the Contractor fails to commence work within five 475\ncalendar days of the date of receipt of notification,\n$100.00 will be assessed as liquidated damages, not as\na penalty, but as damages sustained for each calendar day after five on which work has not commenced.\n480\n5. Once work has commenced in accordance with 3 and\n4 above, the work shall progress continuously and\nshall be completed within 60 calendar days. If such work is not completed within 60 calendar days, $100.00 will be assessed as liquidated damages, not as 485\na penalty, but as damages sustained for each calendar day after 60 on which work is not completed.\n\n6. Each notification received by the Contractor shall\nestablish a separate five calendar day starting period 490\nand 60 calendar day completion time, regardless of the number of parcels which are shown in each notification.\n(a) Excusable, Non-Compensable Delays 495\nExcusable, non-compensable delays are delays that are not the fault or responsibility of the Contractor or the Department. The following are excusable, non-compensable delays:\n1. Delays due to acts of the public enemy, civil 500\ndisturbances, acts of Government or political subdivision other than the Department.\n2. Delays due to floods, lightning strikes, tornadoes,\nearthquakes, or other cataclysmic phenomena of 505\nnature.\n3. Delays due to fires or epidemics.\n4. Delays due to labor strikes that are beyond the 510\nContractor\u2019s reasonable power to settle.\n5. Extraordinary delays in material deliveries the\nContractor or its suppliers cannot foresee or avoid resulting from freight embargoes, government acts, or 515\nwide-area material shortages. Delays due to the 108.08\n98 Contractor\u2019s, subcontractor\u2019s or supplier\u2019s insolvency\nor mismanagement are not excusable.\n6. Delays due to above normal inclement weather as 520\ndefined in 101.02.\n7. Delays due to changes in quantities that are not\nsignificant changes as defined in 104.02(c).\n525\nThe Department will extend the contract time for completion but will not pay for any costs associated with an excusable, non-compensable delay.\n(b) Excusable, Compensable Delays\nExcusable, compensable delays are delays that are not the fault or responsibility 530\nof the Contractor and are the fault or responsibility of the Department. The following are excusable, compensable delays:\n1. Delays due to differing site conditions in accordance with\n104.02(a), significant changes in the character of work in 535\naccordance with 104.02(c), or extra work in accordance with 104.03.\n2. Delays due to suspension of work ordered by the Engineer\nin accordance with 104.02(b). 540\n3. Delays due to work that utilities or other third parties\nperform within the project limits.\n\nThe Department will extend the contract time for completion and will pay for 545\ndelay costs covered under item 1 above in accordance with 104.03.   The Department will make payment for delay costs under items 2 and 3 above in accordance with 109.05.2.  550\n(c) Non-Excusable Delays\nNon-excusable delays are delays that are the fault or responsibility of the Contractor. The Department will not extend the contract time or compensate the Contractor for delay costs due to non-excusable delays.\n555\n(d) Concurrent Delays\nConcurrent delays are separate delays to the controlling operation or critical path\nthat occur at the same time. When an excusable, non-compensable delay is concurrent with an excusable, compensable delay, the Department will extend the contract time but will not make payment for delay costs. When a non-excusable delay is concurrent 560\nwith an excusable delay, the Department will not extend the contract time and will not make payment for delay costs. 108.08\n99\n108.09 Failure to Complete on Time  For each calendar day, as specified, that work shall remain incomplete during the 565\nmonths of April through November inclusive, after the control time specified for the completion of the work provided for in the contract, the sum specified in the Proposal\nor Special Provisions will be deducted, as liquidated damages, from any money due\nthe Contractor. Account will be taken of adjustment of the contract time for completion\nof the work granted in accordance with 108.08.  Contract time will not be charged while 570\nwaiting for final inspection as defined in 105.15 provided all contract work has been\nsatisfactorily completed. However, five workable days during the months of April\nthrough November inclusive will be allowed after notification from the Department to\ncomplete all corrective or clean up work necessary for final inspection. Thereafter, time will be charged for each day the work remains uncompleted.  575\n\nFurther, 10 workable days will be allowed after notification by the Department to remove all construction signs and temporary traffic control devices. Thereafter, time\nwill be charged for each day the sign and device remain.\n580\nFor each calendar day, as specified, that any work shall remain incomplete during the months of December through March inclusive, liquidated damages will be assessed. However, when the project is open for its intended purpose or modified for safe use, liquidated damages will not be deducted, and payment for the field office and field laboratory, if set out as a pay item in the itemized proposal, will not be made. 585\nIntended purpose will include all pavement lanes, sidewalks, trails, drainage features, and all safety appurtenances. The Contractor may be required to make temporary repairs to the pavement or structures. Liquidated damages will be assessed until temporary repairs are made. No payment will be made for such temporary repairs.  590\nIf the contract is not completed, or the pavement or structure is not opened to\ntraffic within the stipulated time as set out in the Proposal, the Department may reduce the qualified rating of the Contractor for bidding on future contracts.\nAllowing the Contractor to continue and finish the work or a part of it after the 595\ntime fixed for its completion, or after the date to which the time for completion may have been extended, will in no way be considered as a waiver on the part of the Department of any of its rights under the contract.   Adjustments to the contract payment with respect to liquidated damages will be 600\nincluded in a liquidated damages pay item. The unit price for this pay item will be $1.00 and the quantity will be in units of dollars. The quantity is the total calculated in\naccordance with the Proposal or Special Provisions.\n108.10 Default and Termination of Contract 605\nNotice in writing will be given to the Contractor and its surety of delay, neglect, or default if the Contractor:  108.09\n100   (a) fails to begin work under the contract within the time specified,\n610\n(b) fails to perform the work with sufficient workmen and\nequipment or with sufficient materials to ensure the prompt completion of said work,\n\n(c) performs the work unsuitably, neglects or refuses to remove 615\nmaterials or performs anew such work as may be rejected as unacceptable and unsuitable,\n(d) discontinues the prosecution of the work,  620\n(e) fails to resume work which has been discontinued within a\nreasonable time after notice to do so,\n(f) becomes insolvent or is declared bankrupt, or commits an act of\nbankruptcy or insolvency, 625\n\n(g) allows final judgment to stand against it unsatisfied for a period\nof 10 days,\n(h) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, 630\n(i) for other causes whatsoever, fails to carry on the work in an\nacceptable manner, or\n(j) fails to implement the employee drug testing plan as submitted 635\nwith the bid, or fails to provide information regarding the\nimplementation of the employee drug testing plan when\nrequested by the Department, or provides false information regarding implementation of the employee drug testing plan.\n640\nIf the Contractor or surety does not proceed in accordance therewith within a period of 10 days after such notice, then the Department will, upon written notification from the Engineer of the fact of delay, neglect, default, or the failure of the Contractor to comply with such notice, have full power and authority, without violating the contract, to take the prosecution of the work away from the Contractor. The 645\nDepartment may appropriate or use materials and equipment on the ground as may be suitable and acceptable and may enter into an agreement for the completion of said contract according to the terms and provisions thereof. Other methods required for the\ncompletion of the contract in an acceptable manner may be used.\n650\nAll costs and charges incurred by the Department, together with the cost of completing the work under the contract, will be deducted from any monies due or which may become due. If such expense exceeds the sum which would have been 108.10\n101 payable under the contract, the Contractor and the surety shall be liable and shall pay\nto the Department the amount of such excess. 655\n108.11 Termination of Contractor\u2019s Responsibility  The contract shall be considered as completed after all work provided for therein\nhas been accepted. The Contractor shall then be released from all further obligations\nexcept as provided in 107.23 and 109.08. 660\nThe Department may, by written order, terminate the contract or a portion thereof only after a meeting with the Contractor, and after determining that termination would be in the public interest. Reasons for termination will include, but will not be limited to, the following: 665\n(a) executive orders of the President relating to prosecution of war\nor national defense,\n(b) national emergency which creates a serious shortage of 670\nmaterials,\n(c) budgetary concerns of the Department,    (d) errors in the plans or Proposal which make the project 675\nunbuildable,\n(e) orders from duly constituted authorities relating to energy\nconservation,\n680\n(f) restraining orders or injunctions obtained by third-party citizen\naction resulting from national or local environmental protection\nlaws, or where the issuance of such order or injunction is primarily caused by acts or omissions of persons or agencies other than the Contractor, 685\n(g) when it is the finding of the Department that the Contractor is\nunable to complete the contract and the construction covered thereby within a reasonable length of time on account of inability to obtain materials or satisfactory substitutes therefore  690\nwhich do not change the general type of construction or labor.\nIn such cases, work performed, including partially completed items, will be paid\nfor in full at the contract unit prices for the actual quantities of work done, which prices\nwill not be subject to change if the quantity for a pay item or items is increased or 695\ndecreased more than 20%. Should such relief from performance of a portion of the contract or such elimination of a portion of the contract directly cause the loss of work or material already furnished under the terms of the contract, the actual cost of such work or of salvaging such material will be reimbursed. All such material may, at the 108.11\n102 option of the Department, be purchased at its actual cost. Anticipated profit on work 700\nnot performed will not be allowed. Final settlement will depend upon the merits of the individual case. All actual damages will be paid following a meeting with the Contractor to determine if payment of actual damages is appropriate and in accordance with applicable laws.\n705\n108.12 Contract Documentation  The Contractor shall furnish upon request, all documentation relating to its performing as a Contractor or subcontractor on a contract. The requested information may be, but is not limited to payroll records, material invoices, subcontract agreements with pertinent attachments, lease agreements, and Equal Employment Opportunity 710\ndocumentation."

    "text": "109.01 Measurement of Quantities\n\n(a) General Requirements 5\nAll measurements of work completed under the contract will be according to the\nEnglish System unless otherwise specified.   The standard measures shown in this publication are primarily in the English System of Units such as feet and inches, pounds, gallons, and acres. Any metric 10\nequivalents, shown in parentheses, are intended only for those contracts in which they are specified, or to maintain consistency with industry standards. No guarantee is provided, explicit or implicit, that the units are accurate conversions.   The method of measurement and computations to be used in determination of 15\nquantities of material furnished and of work performed under the contract will be those\nmethods generally recognized as conforming to good engineering practice. Results are\nto be determined using the standard \u201c5\u201d up procedures as defined in General Note 9 on Page viii herein. When the quantities to be measured are shown in English System units, and the Contractor uses equipment or materials that were originally developed 20\nto be used in performing work in the International System measure, there will be no allowance if the International System dimensions exceed the English System measurements. When the quantities to be measured are shown in International System measure, and the Contractor uses equipment or materials that were originally developed to be used in performing work in the English System units, there will be no 25\nallowance if the International System dimensions exceed the English System measurements.\nUnless otherwise specified, longitudinal measurements for base, surface, and\nshoulder area computations will be made along the centerline of the actual surface of 30\nthe roadway. No deduction will be made for individual fixtures having an area of 10 sq\nft or less. Unless otherwise specified, transverse measurements for area computations will be the neat line dimensions shown on the plans or ordered in writing. 109.01\n103\nStructures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the plans or as 35\naltered to fit field conditions.   When a complete structure or structural unit, in effect lump sum work, is specified\nas the unit of measurement, the unit will be construed to include all necessary fittings\nand accessories. 40\nAll work which is measured by the linear foot will be measured parallel to the base or foundation upon which such work is placed, unless otherwise specified.   A station when used as a definition or term of measurement in the English System 45\nwill be 100 linear feet. A station when used as a definition or term of measurement in the International System will be l km.   When metric dimensioned materials are specified, the Contractor shall convert to metric all weigh tickets, delivery receipts, or other material documentation before 50\nsubmitting the documentation.\nThe term gauge, when used in connection with the measurement of metal plates or sheets, will mean the U.S. Standard Gauge except when the referenced AASHTO, ASTM, or other specification for a material specifies that it be ordered and measured 55\nin terms of thickness.   When the term gauge refers to the measurement of wire, it will mean the U.S. Steel Wire Gauge except when the reference AASHTO, ASTM, or other specification for the wire specifies that it be ordered and measured in terms of wire size number or 60\ndiameter.\n\nThe term ton will mean the short ton consisting of 2,000 pounds avoirdupois. The term megagram will mean 1,000,000 g or 1,000 kg. All materials which are measured or proportioned by weight (mass) shall be weighed on accurate approved scales which 65\nare in accordance with all requirements and specifications adopted by the Indiana State Board of Health, Division of Weights and Measures. The weighing shall be accomplished by competent qualified personnel at designated locations. Materials specified according to metric unit weights may be weighed on a scale that uses English system units and then converted to the metric equivalent using the conversion factors 70\nshown elsewhere in the specifications.    (b) Scales and Measurement by Weight (Mass)\nAll materials for which measurements are obtained by weight (mass) shall be\nweighed on approved scales which, except as hereinafter provided for out-of-state 75\nscales, shall be tested and sealed by the Indiana State Board of Health, Division of\nWeights and Measures. This inspection shall have been made within a period of not more than one year prior to the date of use for weighing material. A scale which has been tested and approved within this one year period and which has been repaired or 109.01\n104 dismantled or moved to another location, shall again be tested and approved before it 80\nis eligible for weighing. All interested parties, such as the Department, the Contractor, or the owner of the scales, may request an inspection of the scales in question. The latest inspection shall take precedence over all previous inspections.\nA motor-truck scale shall have a suitable undercarriage of such construction that 85\nshall safely carry and weigh an amount equal to 80% of the rated capacity of the scale on either end of the scale platform. When so loaded, the stresses in the lever system shall not exceed the stresses allowable under AREA specifications. The load carried per 1 in. of knife-edged bearing shall not exceed 5,000 lb.\n90\nThe scale platform shall be of such length and width as to conveniently accommodate all trucks containing materials which need to be weighed. The entire truck load shall rest on the scale platform and shall be weighed as one draft.   If material is weighed on truck scales, weigh tickets showing the net weight of 95\neach load of material delivered shall be supplied for use in computing quantities. The\ntickets shall contain the ticket serial number, date, contract number, source of supply,\nmaterial designation such as ledge and size or type, DMF or JMF number for HMA,\ntruck number, time weighed, gross weight direct reading if scale is of the direct reading type, tare, net weight, and moisture content if applicable. Space shall be provided on 100\neach ticket for the signature of a representative of the Engineer.\nA duplicate ticket may be furnished by the Contractor for its records. The original, and duplicate if furnished, tickets will be signed at the point of incorporation into the\nwork. E-tickets, when used, shall be in accordance with 106.01(b)2. No additional 105\npayment will be made for furnishing, maintaining, and operating scales.\nThe weight of materials weighed outside the State and intended for use on the\ncontract may be determined on scales tested and approved by the proper governmental unit having authority where the scales are located. In such case, the Department shall 110\nbe furnished with a certified copy of such inspection and approval which, to be acceptable, shall have been made within one year to the time of such weighing. Out-of-state truck scales used shall be in accordance with all pertinent provisions as they apply to truck scales accepted within the State of Indiana. They shall be subject to approval and inspection by the Department and to the requirements applicable to such 115\nscales located within the State.   If materials are shipped by rail, the car weight may be accepted provided payment is made for only the actual weight of the materials. Car weights will not be acceptable\nfor material to be passed through mixing plants. Trucks used to haul material being 120\npaid for by weight shall be weighed empty daily at such times as directed. Each truck shall bear a plainly legible identification mark.    (c) Measurement by Volume\nMaterials to be measured by volume in the hauling vehicle shall be hauled in 125 109.01\n105 approved vehicles and measured therein at the point of delivery. Vehicles for this\npurpose may be of the size or acceptable type provided the body is of such shape that the actual contents may be determined readily and accurately. All vehicles shall be loaded to at least their water level capacity. All loads shall be leveled when directed, after the vehicles arrive at the point of delivery. 130\n\nWhen requested and approved in writing, material specified to be measured by the cubic yard may be weighed. Such weights will be converted to cubic yards for payment purposes. Factors for conversion from weight measurement to volume measurement will be determined and shall be agreed to by the Contractor before such 135\nmethod of measurement of pay quantities is used.   In computing volumes of excavation, the average end area method or other acceptable methods will be used.  140\nIf excavation is measured by cross-sections, the following will apply:\n1. Unless otherwise provided, where sodded areas are involved,\nthe cross-sections will be considered as located at the surface of\nthe sod. 145\n2. If the cost of excavation is specifically included in the payment\nfor a pay item of work, the final sections will be taken at the finished surface of the work.\n150\n3. If the cost of excavation is not specifically included in the\npayment for a pay item of work, the final sections will be taken at the limits of the authorized excavation.\n\nUnauthorized wastage of material will be deducted. Only such quantities as are 155\nactually incorporated into the completed work will be included in the final estimate.\n(d) Measurement of Asphalt Materials\nIf an asphalt material is to be paid for directly, it will, except as hereinafter provided, be weighed and paid for by the ton. If the Engineer decides that weighing is 160\nnot feasible, the asphalt material may be measured by volume and converted to tons. The conversion will be based on the unit weight as determined in the laboratory.   If asphalt material is to be measured by volume, it will be measured by the gallon in tank cars, distributor tanks, tanks, or drums. Certified calibration of tank cars, 165\ndistributor tanks, tanks, and certified quantities in drums in which asphalt materials are delivered or stored shall be furnished.\n\nIf asphalt material is furnished in drums, the amount in each drum shall be stenciled plainly on the drumhead by the producer. The amount so indicated will be 170\naccepted as the quantity furnished. However, the amount in each drum may be checked in accordance with the requirements set out herein. 109.01\n106\nTank car deliveries will be measured by volume and converted to tons.  175\nVolumes will be measured at 60\u00b0F or will be corrected to the volume at 60\u00b0F in accordance with ASTM D1250 for asphalts or ASTM D633 for tars.\n\nNet certified scale weights or weights based on certified volumes in the case of rail shipments will be used as a basis of measurement, subject to correction when 180\nasphalt material has been lost from the car or the distributor, is wasted, or is otherwise not incorporated into the work.    (e) Measurement of PCC\nFor design and production, PCC will be measured by the cubic yard. The relative 185\nyield will be determined in accordance with 505.01. Payment for PCC will be in the unit designated for the specified use.    (f) Measurement of Aggregates\nUnless otherwise provided, all aggregates for which measurements are obtained 190\nby the cubic yard will be measured at the truck loading point in truck beds that have been measured, stenciled, and approved. They may be weighed and converted to cubic yards by a conversion factor computed at sufficient intervals to ensure correct measurement.  195\nFree water in all aggregates for which payment is made as a separate pay item on a weight basis shall be drained prior to weighing and selection of samples. Samples for determination of moisture content shall be taken immediately prior to the time the material is to be weighed. The number of moisture tests will be governed by moisture conditions. Moisture contents shall be determined on the basis of oven dry weight by 200\ndrying samples to constant weight at 230 \u00b19\u00b0F. However, if ovens are not available\nfor drying samples, other methods which give equivalent results may be used. Moisture content shall be computed to the nearest 0.5% in accordance with the formula as follows:  205\nPercent of Moisture (M) = Wet weight of sample-Dry weight of sample\nDry weight of sample\nx 100\n\nThe percent of moisture shall be noted on each weight ticket.\n\nThe wet weight will be used for the basis of payment, if  210\n(a) the % of moisture is determined to be less than 6% for\nB borrow\n(b) 9% or optimum moisture content, as determined in 215\naccordance with AASHTO T 99, whichever is greater, for size No. 53 or No. 73 aggregates or modifications thereof when specified, or 109.01\n107   (c) 4% for aggregates of all other specified sizes including 220\nsand.\nIf the percent of moisture exceeds the limitations set out above, the weight to be\npaid for will be the gross weight of aggregate minus the weight of the excess moisture\ncomputed as follows: 225\n\nWeight to be paid for = G x (100 + m)\n(100 + M)\nin which:\nG = Gross weight of material.\nM = Percent of moisture in the aggregate to the nearest 230\n0.5% based on oven dry weight.\nm = Percent of moisture allowed in the wet aggregate to be\npaid for based on oven dry weight.\n(g) Measurement of Timber or Lumber 235\nTimber or lumber will be measured by the thousand feet board measure or MFBM actually incorporated into the work. Measurement will be based on nominal widths and thicknesses and the extreme length of each piece.    (h) Rental of Equipment 240\nRental of equipment will be measured in hours of actual working time and necessary traveling time of the equipment within the project limits. If special\nequipment has been ordered in connection with force account work, travel time and\ntransportation costs to the project site will be recorded. If equipment has been ordered and held on the project site on a standby basis, full time rates for such equipment will 245\nbe paid.    (i) Manufactured Materials\nIf standard manufactured materials are specified such as fence, wire, plates, rolled shapes, pipe, or conduit, and such materials are identified by gauge, unit weight, or 250\nsection dimensions, such identification will be considered to be nominal weights or dimensions. Unless more stringently controlled by tolerances in cited specifications, manufacturing tolerances established by the industries involved will be accepted. Nearly equivalent metric dimensioned manufactured items will be accepted in lieu of\nEnglish dimensioned items, provided they are within the specified tolerances, when 255\nEnglish sizes are specified. Nearly equivalent English dimensioned manufactured\nitems will be accepted in lieu of metric dimensioned items, provided they are within the specified tolerances, when metric sizes are specified.   109.02 Scope of Payment 260\nCompensation provided for in the contract shall be received and accepted as full payment for furnishing all materials and for performing all work specified in the contract in a complete and acceptable manner. This shall also be payment in full for 109.02\n108 all risk, loss, damage, or expense of whatever character arising out of the nature of the\nwork or the prosecution thereof, in accordance with 107.23. 265\nIf the basis of payment clause in the specifications relating to a unit price in the Schedule of Pay Items requires that said unit price cover and be considered\ncompensation for certain work or material essential to the pay item, this same work or\nmaterial will not also be measured or paid for under another pay item which may 270\nappear elsewhere in the specifications.   The term lump sum when used as a unit of payment will mean complete payment for the pay items of work described in the contract.  275\nThe payment of a current estimate before final acceptance of the work shall not affect the obligation of the Contractor to repair or renew any defective parts of the construction. The responsibility for all damages due to such defects will be determined in accordance with 107.19.\n280\nIf it is agreed in writing that the quantities of certain items or portions of items of\nwork, as set forth in the contract, are in substantial agreement with actual quantities of work performed, compensation therefore will be based on the quantities set forth in\nthe contract without measurement thereof upon completion of the work. Compensation based on contract quantities as agreed shall be accepted as full payment for such items 285\nor portions of items.   If the Contractor has previously agreed in writing to accept photogrammetric methods of measurement for common excavation and borrow, the Department may utilize such methods of measurement as the basis of payment. Computation of volumes 290\nshall be in accordance with 203.\n\n109.03 Compensation for Altered Quantities  If the accepted quantities of work vary from the quantities shown in the Schedule of Pay Items, the Contractor shall accept as payment in full, so far as contract items 295\nare concerned, payment at the original contract unit prices for the accepted quantities\nof work performed. No allowance, except as provided in 104.02, will be made for increased expense, loss of expected reimbursement, or loss of anticipated profits suffered or claimed by the Contractor resulting either directly from such alterations or indirectly from unbalanced allocation among the contract items of overhead expense 300\non the part of the bidder and subsequent loss of expected reimbursement therefore, or from any other cause.\nIf an increase or decrease in a contract item is in accordance with 104.02, the\ncontract unit price will be the rate of payment unless an adjusted price is agreed to by 305\nthe parties to the contract. The contract unit price for a minor item may be adjusted if agreed to by parties for only that portion of the item which exceeds 6% of the total bid amount of the contract. A loss or gain of overhead costs will not be a consideration for adjusting the unit prices. 109.03\n109  310\nIf such alteration directly causes the loss of any work or materials already furnished under the terms of the original contract, the actual cost of such work or of salvaging such materials will be reimbursed. All such materials may, at the option of the Department, be purchased at the actual cost including freight to the Contractor,\nplus 12%. 315\n109.04 Cost Reduction Incentive, CRI  The Contractor may submit a written proposal for modifying the Contract Documents for the purpose of reducing construction costs or contract time. The proposal shall produce a savings without impairing essential functions, characteristics, 320\nand timing of the project including, but not limited to, safety, service life, economy of operations, the traveling public, ease of maintenance, desired appearance, design standards and construction schedules.    (a) CRI Initial Requirements 325\nThe Contractor shall initially submit five copies of a brief proposal to the\nDepartment to illustrate the concept or idea. At a minimum, the Contractor shall\nsubmit the following:\n\n1. A statement that the proposal is submitted as a conceptual CRI. 330\n2. A brief proposal with graphics, if appropriate, to illustrate and\ndescribe the concept.\n3. A brief description of the existing work and the proposed 335\nchanges for performing the work including a discussion of the comparative advantages and disadvantages for each and how the proposal meets the original intent of the design.\n\n4. An approximate cost estimate for performing the work under 340\nthe existing contract and under the proposed change.\n5. An approximate cost estimate of design and engineering fees\nassociated with the proposed change.\n345\n6. A description of any effects the proposed change would have\non Department costs other than those in the contract such as future construction, design, right-of-way, utilities, maintenance,\nand operations costs.\n350\n7. The amount of time that will be needed to develop a formal CRI\nproposal.\n8. A statement of the date by which the Department must execute\nan agreement adopting the proposal to obtain the maximum cost 355\nreduction during the remainder of the contract time, the date the 109.04\n110 work must begin in order to not delay the contract, and the\nreasoning for this time schedule.\n9. An approximate estimate of the effect the proposal will have on 360\nthe time for completion of the contract, including development\nof the formal proposal, review by the Department and\nimplementation.\n10. The name of the redesign professional engineer, if any. 365\n11. Reference to the applicable Indiana Design Manual provisions.\n12. A statement regarding impacted permit requirements.  370\n13. Identification of any material not in the current contract that the\ncontractor proposes to use and corresponding applicable specifications.\n\nThe Department will notify the Contractor in writing within five business days 375\nafter receipt of the proposal that the proposal has been rejected, accepted, or that a meeting needs to be arranged to discuss the proposed conceptual CRI. If the Department fails to respond within five business days, the proposal will be deemed rejected. If a meeting is requested, the Contractor shall arrange a meeting involving any professional engineer that will be used in development of the proposal, the 380\nengineer who designed the original plans or review engineer designated by the Department, contractor personnel, and Department personnel as determined by the Engineer. This meeting shall be held within 10 business days of receipt of the written notification, unless the Engineer approves additional time. At least two business days\nprior to the meeting, the Contractor shall provide a copy of its conceptual CRI to all 385\npersons invited to the meeting. Within 10 business days or a mutually agreed upon time after this meeting, the Department will notify the Contractor in writing as to whether a complete CRI may be developed.    (b) CRI Formal Proposal Requirements 390\nIf a concept is accepted by the Department, a formal proposal shall be submitted with a statement identifying the proposal as a CRI and shall contain, at a minimum, information as follows:     1. A description of the difference between the planned work and 395\nthe proposed change with a comparison of effects on safety,\nservice life, economy of operations, the traveling public, ease\nof maintenance, desired appearance, design standards, and construction schedules.\n400\n2. Proposed changes in the contract documents. Documents\nshowing design changes shall be signed and bear the seal of a 109.04\n111 Professional Engineer. Design changes shall be supported by\ndesign computations as necessary for a thorough and expeditious evaluation. 405\n3. The pay items, unit prices, and quantities affected by the\nchange.\n4. Complete, detailed cost estimates for performance of the work 410\nboth as planned and as proposed.\n5. The calendar date required for approval of the proposal in order\nto produce the savings indicated.\n415\n6. Locations and situations, including test results, in which similar\nmeasures have been successfully used.\n7. A statement regarding the effect the proposal will have on the\ncontract completion time. 420\n8. A signed contract between the Contractor and the Contractor\u2019s\nredesign engineer, who prepared and sealed the plans for the CRI proposal, shall be submitted to the Department. The contract shall provide for the following: 425\na. The Contractor\u2019s redesign engineer shall be responsible\nfor the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, load rating analysis, and other services furnished by the 430\nredesign engineer under this contract. The redesign\nengineer shall correct or revise any errors or omissions in its designs, drawings, specifications, and other services. The Contractor\u2019s redesign engineer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the State and its 435\nagents, officials, and employees, from all claims and suits including court costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and other expenses caused by any acts, errors, or omissions of the Contractor\u2019s redesign engineer, its agents, or employees, in connection with the CRI proposal. 440\n\nb. Neither the Department\u2019s review, approval, nor\nacceptance of the plans for the CRI shall be construed to operate as a waiver of rights under the contract or\ncause of action arising out of the contract. The 445\nContractor\u2019s redesign engineer shall be and shall remain liable to the Department for all damages caused by the Contractor\u2019s redesign engineer.\n109.04\n112     c. The rights and remedies of the Department provided in 450\nthe contract are in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law.\n\nd. No terms between the Contractor and the redesign\nengineer shall adversely affect the Department\u2019s 455\nliability protection.\n\n9. The Contractor\u2019s engineering costs to develop the proposal\nshall be submitted with full documentation.\n460\nAdditional information shall be provided as required to properly evaluate the proposed change. Failure to do so may result in rejection of the cost reduction incentive proposal.    (c) Approval of Formal CRI Proposal 465\nThe Engineer will be the sole judge as to whether a formal CRI proposal qualifies for consideration, evaluation, and approval. A proposal which requires excessive time or cost for review, evaluation, or investigation, or which is not consistent with Department design policies, may be rejected. A proposal may also be rejected if not submitted within the time frame specified in the Contractor\u2019s conceptual proposal, 470\nunless the Engineer approves additional time. Proposed changes in pavement design\nincluding materials or pavement type, changes in materials required to be installed by a certified installer, or changes in right-of-way will not be approved. A proposal which uses empirical design (AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, Section 9.7.2) of the concrete bridge deck will not be considered or approved. Only proposals which 475\nresult in the Department\u2019s portion of the estimated net savings being $10,000.00 or more will be considered. Except as provided in 109.04(d), the Department will not be liable for failure to accept or act upon a proposal submitted in accordance with the requirements herein or for delays to the work attributable to such proposal, unless an extension of time is provided as part of the agreed CRI proposal. 480\nOriginal contract bid prices shall not be based on the anticipated approval of a\nCRI proposal. If the proposal is rejected, the contract shall be completed at the original\ncontract prices. If a CRI proposal is not approved on or before the calendar date submitted by the Contractor in the CRI shown on the proposal, such proposal will be 485\ndeemed rejected. In determining the estimated net savings, the contract prices bid may be disregarded if it is determined that such prices do not represent a fair measure of the value of the work to be performed or deleted.   The CRI proposal will not be approved if equivalent options are already available 490\nwithin the contract, or if the Department is already considering a change order to the contract which includes the proposal revisions.\nWhen a CRI proposal is received which changes superstructure type,\nsuperstructure dimensions, or superstructure dead load, the Engineer will perform a 495\nload rating analysis on the proposed structure. The load rating analysis must yield an 109.04\n113 inventory rating of 1.0 or greater for the design live load in order to be considered for\napproval. If the inventory rating is less than 1.0, the proposed design shall be modified so that the load rating analysis yields an inventory rating of 1.0 or greater for the design live load before the CRI proposal is considered for approval. 500\n\nIf the CRI proposal is approved, it will be executed by means of a change order.\nThe change order will show the changes in the plans and specifications necessary to enable the proposal to be put into effect and the net estimated savings will be set forth on the change order. 505\nUpon approval, the Department will have the right to use, duplicate, and disclose in whole or in part, all data necessary for the subsequent adoption of the proposal for future projects.  510\nThe provisions of this specification will apply only to a contract awarded to the lowest bidder in accordance with the Department\u2019s competitive bidding requirements.\n(d) Payment for Design of Formal Proposal, if Rejected\nExcept as provided elsewhere herein, if the Department rejects the formal CRI 515\nproposal, the Contractor will be reimbursed for 50% of the Contractor\u2019s reasonable design costs incurred after the Department\u2019s acceptance of the CRI conceptual proposal.   The Contractor will also be reimbursed for 50% of the Contractor\u2019s reasonable 520\ndesign costs of an approved CRI proposal if the Department determines that the proposal is no longer feasible because of changes in field conditions or other conditions beyond the control of the Contractor. If written approval was given to proceed with the work, procure materials, begin fabrication, and rejection occurs, the\nwork and fabrication costs will be reimbursed in accordance with 109.05. The 525\nContractor will be compensated for materials ordered which are unique to the project based on the Contractor\u2019s cost minus salvage value if the Contractor is unable to return these items to the vendor. All such material may, at the option of the Department, be purchased at its actual cost. There will be no reimbursement for costs incurred prior to the acceptance of the conceptual CRI proposal. The Contractor will not be reimbursed 530\nfor design costs if a formal CRI proposal is rejected because it was not submitted within the time frame specified in the Contractor\u2019s conceptual proposal or additional time approved by the Engineer, if the Contractor fails to submit additional information requested by the Department, or if the design criteria used in the proposal does not comply with the Department\u2019s design standards. 535\n\n(e) Other Conditions\nThe Contractor shall continue to perform the work in accordance with the contract requirements until a change order incorporating the CRI proposal has been approved. However, no contract work that will be affected by a CRI proposal shall be performed 540\nuntil the CRI proposal has been approved or rejected.  109.04\n114  Prior to approval, the Engineer may modify a proposal with the concurrence of\nthe Contractor, to enhance it or make it acceptable. If any modification increases or decreases the net savings resulting from the proposal, the Contractor\u2019s 50% share will 545\nbe determined upon the basis of the proposal as modified.\nThe Department reserves the right to include in the change order the conditions it\ndeems appropriate for consideration, approval, and implementation of the CRI\nproposal. Acceptance of the change order by the Contractor shall constitute acceptance 550\nof such conditions. As a condition for considering a Contractor\u2019s CRI proposal, the Department also reserves the right to require the Contractor to share in the Department\u2019s costs of investigating the proposal. If this condition is imposed, the Contractor shall indicate acceptance in writing. Such acceptance shall constitute full authority for the Department to deduct amounts for the investigation from moneys due 555\nthe Contractor under the contract.   The Engineer may reject, in accordance with 105.03 and 105.11, all or any portion of work performed under an approved CRI proposal.\n560\n(f) Time Savings Proposals  The Contractor may submit a CRI proposal that reduces contract time by changing phasing of the work, the traffic control plan, or design elements.   The Department will consider proposals that result in time savings and at the same 565\ntime may increase the cost of the project. The Department will be the sole judge as to whether the benefits of completing the project or a project phase before the scheduled completion date or milestone offsets an increase to the cost of the project.   The submittals for time savings will be reviewed using the CRI proposal process. 570\nThe Contractor shall provide the Department sufficient information to enable the\nDepartment to evaluate the cost benefit of the savings.    (g) Adjustments to Contract Time\nFor approved formal CRI proposals the Department will adjust the applicable 575\ncontract time as set out in the proposal. Any adjustment will be set forth in the change order for the CRI proposal. Depending on the Contractor\u2019s proposal, the adjustment will be an increase or decrease in the appropriate completion date.    (h) Method of Measurement 580\nThe work, as revised by the formal CRI proposal, will be measured as complete and in place and in accordance with the change order.\n\n(i) Basis of Payment  The work, as revised by the formal CRI proposal, will be paid for as complete and 585\nin place and in accordance with the change order. In addition, the Contractor\u2019s Reasonable Design Cost and 50% of the total net savings of the CRI proposal will be paid for separately as follows: 109.04\n115\n1. The Contractor\u2019s Reasonable Design Cost for the CRI 590\nproposal will be paid for after approving the formal CRI proposal with the change order.\n\n2. Upon completion of all items of work included in the\nchange order, the total net savings will be calculated, and 595\nthe Contractor will be paid 50% of the total net savings.\nThe total net savings resulting from the CRI will be\ncalculated as follows:\n600\nTNS = OCW \u2013 RCW \u2013 CRDC \u2013 DC\nwhere:\nTNS = total net savin\ngs\nOCW = ori ginal cost of the work required b y the ori ginal contract\nRCW = revised cost of the work\nCRDC = Contractor\u2019s reasonable desi gn cost for the CRI proposal\nDC = Department\u2019s cost for investigating, evaluating, and\nimplementing the CRI proposal.\n\n3. A cost savings of not less than $5,000.00 shall be 605\nguaranteed to the Department.\nThe actual formal CRI proposal net savings will be checked upon completion of the contract and determination of final quantities to determine if any payment adjustment is required. 610\n\nOnly those work items directly affected by the plan change will be considered in\nmaking the determination of net cost savings. Subsequent plan changes affecting the modified work items but not related to the CRI proposal will be excluded from such determination. Upon completion of all work included in the CRI proposal, the final 615\ntotal net savings will be determined by comparing the cost of the work based on the original contract quantities with the cost of the actual CRI proposal work performed.    In determining the savings, the Department reserves the right to consider other factors in addition to the contract bid prices and proposed unit prices if, in the judgment 620\nof the Department, such prices do not represent a fair measure of the value of the work to be deleted from or added to the contract.\n\nThe net savings of a CRI proposal to reduce contract time will be determined by multiplying the number of days saved by the daily liquidated damages as set forth in 625"

The Department may use, or cause to be used, such materials in the construction of the work provided for in\nthe contract.\n30\nAlthough payment may have been made for materials, the Contractor shall be responsible for loss or damage to the materials. Such materials shall be replaced with no additional payment.   Approval of partial payment for stockpiled materials will not constitute final 35\nacceptance of such materials for use in completing the work. Stockpiled materials may be subjected to additional inspection and testing prior to final acceptance and incorporation into the work. Partial payments for stockpiled materials that are a portion\nof the pay item will be deducted from estimates due the Contractor as the material is incorporated in the work. 40\n\n111.03 Materials    (a) Structural Steel, Concrete Structural Members, and Supports for\nSignals, Signs, and Luminaires 45\nPartial payment for these pay items will be considered only when the total quantity 111.01\n128 for an entire structure, or designated portion of a structure as specified on the plans\nand approved by the Engineer, has been completely fabricated.

Should any underground drain be encountered, the location of which is not shown on the plans, notification shall be made at once.\nDrainage shall be explored as directed and, if deemed necessary, taken care of under\napplicable provisions of these specifications, or as otherwise directed.  510\nIf existing surface drains, tile drains, sewers, or other underground drains, or parts thereof, are not to be replaced or are not required by the terms of the contract or directed to be changed, whether such drainage facilities are shown on the plans or not, all such drainage facilities or parts thereof shall be protected, preserved, and satisfactorily continued in use without change. If in the prosecution of the work such 515\nexisting drainage is changed or interrupted, or through negligence such drainage is interrupted or damaged, satisfactory permanent repairs shall be immediately provided or adequate temporary drainage facilities shall be maintained until permanent repairs\nare made. If temporary facilities are provided before the work is accepted, such\ndamage or interrupted drainage facilities shall be restored to the original condition or 520\nto an altered state which is at least equal to their original condition.   If slopes or ditches which were graded for a grading contract become eroded or scoured during the paving contract work, the scoured or eroded areas shall be reshaped 203.14\n164 to the original cross-section and reseeded or resodded as shown on the plans, in 525\naccordance with 208 and 621.\nWhen provided by the plans or special provisions, or as ordered, all tile drains, sewers, or other underground drains encountered in the prosecution of the contract\nshall be repaired, replaced, extended, reconstructed, connected, or otherwise changed. 530\nUnless otherwise provided in the contract, the cost of replacing, restoring, or connecting an underground drain which is substantially in its original location and incidental to roadway and drainage excavation, structures, or other drains will not be paid for directly, but the cost thereof shall be included in the cost of various pay items. 535\nUnless otherwise provided, any necessary drainage change or restoration not shown on the plans and not due to negligence or operations of the Contractor will be paid for at the contract unit price or prices thereof. If there is no such contract unit\nprice or prices, such work shall be performed and payment made in accordance with 540\n104.03.\n\n203.15 Excavating Rock\nIf material is encountered during excavation which appears to belong in the classification of rock excavation in accordance with 203.03, notification shall be made 545\nin writing. Ample time shall be allowed to make such investigation and measurements that are necessary to determine the class and volume of the material in question.   Exploratory cores shall be taken from the top of the rock to approximately subgrade elevation as directed. The cores shall be cut with standard diamond core bits 550\nand series X double tube core barrels to obtain 2 1/8 in. diameter samples. All cores shall be suitably marked and identified to show the location of the core by station,\noffset from centerline, elevation of top of rock, depth below top of rock, and percent\nrecovery within each core. All cores shall be retained. The cores shall be placed in suitable compartmented wooden boxes in the order in which removed from the boring, 555\nwith dividers between core runs. The top and bottom of each run shall be appropriately marked. The cores shall be transported to a location as directed.   The top of rock elevations shall be determined prior to locating the top of soil cut slopes where finished rock slopes are planned to be 1:1 or steeper. 560\nFinal breakage of rock excavation shall be in accordance with, or closely to, the slope lines as shown on the plans unless different slope lines are fixed, and the Contractor so notified. The final slopes shall be left reasonably smooth and uniform,\nand all loose and overhanging rock removed.

Rock shall be excavated to the required elevation for the full width of the roadbed 570 203.15\n165 as shown on the plans or as directed. Where rock is excavated below the required\nelevation, the area shall be backfilled to the subgrade elevation with crushed stone, spalls, subbase material, or other approved granular material, which shall be shaped and compacted to the required elevation and cross-section.\n575\nExploratory drilling, which shall consist of drilling holes for the purpose of\ndetermining the existence of cavities affecting underground drainage and possible sinkholes in cut sections, may be required at locations as directed. Unless otherwise directed, the holes shall be drilled on the centerline of the proposed pavement at approximately 100 ft intervals and shall extend for a depth of 7 ft below the proposed 580\ngrade and have a minimum diameter of 1 1/2 in.   Where cavities are discovered on centerline, additional holes shall be drilled at 25 ft intervals along the edge of the proposed pavement, and unless otherwise directed, extend for a depth of 7 ft below the proposed grade. Where any cavity is discovered 585\nor exposed having a minimum cover of less than 5 ft, the cover shall be removed and\nthe treatment of such areas shall be in accordance with details in the plans or as\notherwise directed.\nThe final surface of rock excavation under the roadbed area shall be left so that 590\ndrainage between the rock surfaces and any material placed thereon will be substantially complete. Where seams of clay or other soft material 1 ft or less in thickness are encountered in rock excavation, the volume of such seams will be considered as rock excavation and paid for as such.  595\nUnless otherwise specified or directed, rock shall be pre-split by drilling and the use of explosives in such a manner as results in minimum breakage outside neat lines of the typical cross-section and slope stakes as established. Deposits of commercial\nbuilding stone outside the right-of-way shall not be damaged. Holes for pre-splitting\nshall be drilled along the established slope stake lines. The holes shall be from 2 to 600\n4 in. in diameter and, unless otherwise directed, be spaced approximately 3 ft apart. Holes shall be drilled approximately 2 ft below the established grade of the cut, or the predetermined bench elevation, or as directed.   The maximum depth of any pre-split lift shall be 30 ft, unless otherwise directed. 605\nIf more than one lift is required, the first line of drill holes shall be set in such a manner as to allow for a specified offset for each succeeding lift and an offset of 2 ft from the back of the paved side ditch line. The explosives used and the method of loading depends on the material to be blasted. These explosives may vary from a single strand of detonating cord, for blasting unconsolidated formations, to a solid column of 610\ndynamite for massive formations. However, the explosive shall be of a type to\naccomplish the pre-splitting with a minimum of breakage outside the excavated area. After the charges are placed, the holes shall be filled with sand or other suitable granular material.\n615\nExcept as indicated below, all pre-splitting charges shall be detonated 203.15\n166 simultaneously by the use of instantaneous electric blasting caps or by means of a\ndetonating cord trunkline. The line holes shall be fired before the main excavation is blasted. Pre-splitting shall be kept well in advance of regular blasting operations. Primary blasting holes shall be drilled no less than 6 ft from the pre-split face, unless 620\notherwise directed. If additional charges are required, holes shall be placed at 1/2 the\ndistance of a full depth hole to a depth such that the bottom of the hole clears the\npre-split face approximately 2 ft. The pre-split face shall deviate no more than 6 in. from the front line of drill holes or more than 12 in. from the back line of drill holes, except where the character of the rock will unavoidably result in some irregularities. 625\nThe amount of explosives per shot for instantaneous firing or the amount of explosives per delay for delay firing shall not be great enough to damage nearby structures, rock formations, or other property. Where commercial building stone formations are located in the effective vicinity, adequate seismograph readings shall 630\nbe obtained, with no additional payment, as evidence that blasting operations have not altered existing commercial building stone formations outside the right-of-way limits of the project.\n\nPermission may be granted to use machine methods to establish the finished 635\nslopes in those cuts where machine methods are used to remove roadway excavation, provided final machine finished slopes are equal or superior to that which would be obtained by pre-splitting methods.   When or where any direct or indirect damage or injury is done to public or private 640\nproperty by or on account of any act, omission, neglect, or misconduct in the execution of the work or in consequence of the non-execution thereof, such property shall be restored, with no additional payment, to a condition similar or equal to that existing before such damage or injury was done by repairing, rebuilding, or otherwise restoring\nas directed, or such damage or injury shall be made good in an acceptable manner. 645\nNo direct payment will be made for pre-splitting, but the cost thereof shall be included in the pay item of rock excavation or unclassified excavation.   203.16 Peat Deposit Treatment 650\nIf construction is specified at a location where a peat deposit is to be treated, the deposit shall be treated ahead of paving operations to obtain maximum settlement. If settlement has not been obtained when paving operations are at the limits of any peat deposit treatment, a gap in the pavement shall be left as directed. Gaps not constructed as part of the project will become an exception to the contract. 655\n\nTreatment shall be by the following methods:\n(a) Treatment of Existing Fills\nIf the required alignment is on an existing fill over a peat deposit, treatment may 660\nbe required by any one or any combination of the following methods:  203.16\n167    1. removal of the existing fill with or without the removal of\nthe underlying peat and of the material at the sides of the existing fill; 665\n\n2. blasting the peat under the fill;\n\n3. loading the existing fill with additional fill material, and, if\ndirected, blasting the peat underneath; 670\n\n4. leaving the existing fill in place and treating the material at\nthe sides either by removing the peat at the sides and backfilling or by displacement or both;\n675\n5. excavating and constructing with lightweight fills.\n\nDetermination of the method or methods to be used will be made based on\nconclusions from test holes which may be required to be drilled at designated locations. 680\n(b) Treatment by Removal\nThis method consists of completely removing the objectionable material either as peat excavation or by machine operation and backfilling to the full toe-width of the\nproposed embankment or to such other widths, if directed, depending on the condition 685\nand depth of the material to be removed.   If water is not present, the space previously occupied by the removed material\nshall be backfilled with common excavation, borrow, or both, and placed in\naccordance with 203. 690\nIf water is present, the backfill shall be with material in accordance with 211.02 with the exception that ACBF or GBF shall not be used. Placement of this material shall follow as closely behind the removal of the peat as possible. It shall be carried across the area from one end to the other by end-dumping and finally left at the 695\nestablished grade. This grade shall be such that end-dumping is kept to a minimum,\nwhich nominally shall be approximately 2 ft above free water level. That portion between free water level and this established grade shall be thoroughly water soaked to secure maximum compaction.  700\nIf additional fill is needed to bring the embankment to its final required grade, it\nmay be common excavation or borrow. Further placing of the granular material above the end-dumped material may be authorized. This additional fill shall be placed and compacted in accordance with 203 but shall not be placed for at least 14 days after the end-dumped material is placed and compacted. This period may be shortened or 705\nlengthened with written approval, depending on the settlement that has been obtained.    (c) Treatment by Displacement\nWhen this method is used, the peat at each end of the deposit shall be removed 203.16\n168 completely by excavation to the full width shown on the plans, or to such other width 710\nas may be directed, until a point is reached where the depth of the peat being removed is greater than 10 ft, or to a greater or lesser depth, as directed.   If conditions allow, the upper portions of the remaining peat shall be excavated\nacross the remainder of the deposit in the same manner as set out above for the ends. 715\nRemoval of this upper portion shall begin at one end and proceed to the other end at a sufficient distance ahead of backfilling operations so displacement of the remaining peat will not be retarded. If excavation to the required depth is not maintained for the full width ahead of the backfill or surcharge, additional units shall be used or backfill operations stopped until the two operations are in balance. If conditions allow, 720\ndraglines shall be operated from mats in front of the advancing excavation. If blasting is required to aid displacement, it shall be completed as extra work in accordance with 104.03.   Backfilling shall be in accordance with 203.16(b) for end-dumped material 725\nexcept, when required, a temporary surcharge shall be maintained at the head of the\nbackfilling. The top of the surcharge shall be constructed and maintained to a width\nequal to the full shoulder width of the proposed embankment, or as approved or directed. The height of the surcharge shall be the same as the depth of the peat being treated, unless otherwise directed. The original ground shall be the reference elevation 730\nfor measuring peat depths and surcharge heights. The top of the surcharge shall be approximately level and the length on top shall be at least two times the depth of the peat being treated. The surcharge shall be kept built up and pushed forward with a bulldozer or other approved equipment as the displacement progresses. Machine methods shall be used to relieve pressure at the advancing toe and sides of the 735\nsurcharge. Sufficient hauling units shall be used to maintain the surcharge at the required height, width, and length. The machine operation to augment displacement\nshall be coordinated with the rate of placing temporary surcharge.\nAfter the granular backfill has been completed across the deposit, any remaining 740\nfill necessary to bring the embankment up to the required final grade shall be in accordance with 203.16(b) for that portion above the end-dumped material.   203.17 Cased Test Holes  As displacement progresses, cased test holes shall be placed at locations as 745\ndirected to determine the extent of peat displacement and for use in conjunction with final measurement. These holes shall extend to the bottom of the deposit. The boring shall be conducted in such a manner that accurate information may be obtained as to the nature of the materials through which the test holes are placed. If these test holes\nindicate that full displacement has not been obtained, the remaining peat shall be 750\nblasted or additional treatment shall be performed as required.   Unless otherwise specified in writing, cased test holes shall be placed by hydraulic boring. The external casing shall be a minimum of 2 in. in diameter and of such additional size as to perform the operation satisfactorily. A continuous supply of fresh 755 203.17\n169 water shall be jetted through an internal pipe so that the wash water and loosened\nmaterial is carried to the surface between the jet rod and the external casing. Pumps and other miscellaneous tools and equipment shall be used as required to perform a satisfactory operation.  760\n203.18 Embankment Construction\nEmbankment construction shall consist of constructing roadway embankments,\nincluding preparation of the areas upon which they are to be placed, the construction\nof dikes within or outside the right-of-way, the placing and compacting of approved\nmaterial within roadway areas where unsuitable material has been removed, and the 765\nplacing and compacting of embankment material in holes, pits, and other depressions within the roadway area.

Any defect shall be corrected as directed.\n203.25\n182  Upon acceptance, a layer of geotextile in accordance with 918.02(a) Type 2B, 1280\nshall be placed and the remaining embankment shall be constructed with No. 53 aggregate in accordance with 301.   At locations inaccessible to the above compacting equipment, the required\ncompaction shall be obtained with approved mechanical tamps or vibrators. In these 1285\ncases the depth of lifts, loose measurement, shall not exceed 4 in.\n203.26 Proofrolling\nWhen proofrolling is specified for a material, it shall be performed with an on-\nhighway dump truck with a minimum tire pressure of 90 psi. Drop axles, if equipped, 1290\nshall be in the raised position. The operating speed of the dump truck shall not exceed\n2 mph.\n\nAll materials in the area requiring proofrolling shall be traversed with as many\npasses as necessary to achieve coverage of the area.  1295\n\nA pass will be defined as a single trip of the dump truck in one direction on the\nmaterial surface area.\nCoverage will be defined as the entire width and length of the material surface 1300\narea required to be proofrolled having been in contact with the pneumatic tires of the\ndump truck.\n\nThe weight of the dump truck and measured deflection or rutting shall be as\nfollows: 1305\n\nMaterial Requiring Proofrolling Dump Truck\nWeight, minimum Allowable\nDeflection or Ruttin g\nOriginal ground or embankment\nfoundation 15 t \u0094\u0003\u0014\u0003LQ\u0011 *\nEmbankment construction,\nsubgrade, or subbase 33 t \u0094\u00031/2 in.\nCement stabilized subgrade soil in\naccordance with 219 33 t \u0094\u0003\u0014\u0012\u0017\u0003LQ\u0011\n* The Department\u2019s Geotechnical Engineering Division will be contacted for deflection or\nrutting greater than 5 in.\n\nWhen the measured deflection or rutting exceeds the allowable values for the\nrespective material listed in the table above, the Contractor shall repair or remediate\nthe material to bring it in compliance with the specifications. Upon completion of the 1310\nremediation or repair of the material, proofrolling shall be performed again and\ndeflections or rutting rechecked for compliance with the table above. This process\nshall be repeated until the measured deflection or rutting complies with the\nspecification, prior to the placement of additional material. 203.26\n183  1315\nRoller marks, irregularities, or failures shall be corrected prior to placement of\nsubsequent work.\n203.27 Method of Measurement\n1320\n(a) Contract Quantity\nThe quantities of excavation for which payment will be made will be those shown\nin the Schedule of Pay Items, provided the project is constructed to the lines and grades\nshown on the plans.  1325\nUnless otherwise specified, the project limits will be considered as one balance. If earthwork balances are shown on the plans, they are for information only.   When the plans have been altered or when disagreement exists as to the accuracy of the plan quantities in any balance, or the contract quantity, either party shall have 1330\nthe right to request and cause the quantities involved to be measured in accordance\nwith measured quantities. When the quantities are measured for payment, the original\nplan cross-sections plotted on the plans shall be used as original field cross-sections.\nAdditional original cross-sections may be interpolated at points where necessary to determine the quantities more accurately. If the Contractor has acceptable engineered 1335\ndata that indicates an excavation quantity that is in error by more than 2%, then additional measurements will be performed on the areas in question and payment will be made for actual quantities.    (b) Measured Quantities 1340\nWhen payment is specified on a volume basis, all accepted excavation and borrow will be measured in its original position by cross-sectioning the area excavated, which\nmeasurements will include over-breakage or slides in common excavation and\nunclassified excavation, not attributable to carelessness, and authorized excavation of rock, shale, peat, or other unsuitable material. Volumes will be computed from cross- 1345\nsection measurements by the average end area method.   Measurement for payment will not include material excavated beyond authorized cross-sections. Where material is excavated beyond authorized cross-sections and wasted without authority, the material so wasted will be measured and deducted from 1350\nthe excavation quantities. Unless otherwise authorized, the amount of waste to be deducted, when common excavation, rock excavation, unclassified excavation, borrow, or other excavation has been wasted along embankments or elsewhere without authority shall be that portion of the embankment or fill which is outside a 1/4 to 1\nslope in excess of that shown on the plans, and all portions outside a line from the 1355\nshoulder point to a point 4 ft, measured horizontally, outside the theoretical toe of the slope. In determining waste, no tolerance in widths of shoulders will be allowed unless additional widths are authorized in writing before shoulders are finally constructed.   Measurements will be made for unsuitable materials actually excavated and 1360 203.27\n184 removed to obtain proper compaction in cut sections and in foundations for fill\nsections.   Where it is impracticable to measure material by the cross-section method due to\nthe erratic location of isolated deposits, acceptable methods involving three- 1365\ndimensional measurements may be used to measure the material in its original\nposition.   The cubic yards of peat excavated will be determined by cross-sections, as described above, with the final cross-sections taken after complete excavation and 1370\nbefore placing granular backfill, if peat is removed by excavation. When removal by displacement is necessary, final cross-sections will be derived from cased test holes through the completed granular treatment in accordance with 203.17. Such test holes shall be located at intervals which clearly define the bottom of the treatment between lateral limits. Pay quantities of peat excavation will be limited to the volume of peat 1375\npresent between vertical lines as shown on the plans for lateral limits.\n\nCased test holes and exploratory drilling will be measured by the linear foot. B\nborrow will be measured by the cubic yard, in accordance with 211.09. However,\nmeasurement to neat lines will not apply unless specifically designated. Breaking 1380\npavement will be measured by the square yard in place before breaking.    (c) Measurement on a Linear Basis\nLinear grading will be measured by the linear foot. Measurement will be made once along each survey centerline for all linear grading completed on the line. 1385\nDeductions will be made for bridges. Classes of excavation, except for required borrow, involved in linear grading will not be measured.\n(d) Measurement of Excavation Items on a Weight Basis\nA pay item for excavation may be specified to be measured and paid for on a 1390\nweight basis. When a weight basis is specified, the material will be weighed in accordance with 109.01(b).    (e) Measurement of Embankments  When specified, embankments constructed will be measured in accordance with 1395\nthe terms set forth.   When embankment is specified as a separate pay item, the volume as constructed will be measured in place in accordance with 203.27(b). However, no measurement will be made for excavation or borrow, except as noted herein. The volume shall be 1400\ncomputed in cubic yards from the dimensions of the embankment cross-sections and\nto the depth below completed grade to which this method of construction applies. No shrinkage factor shall be used in computing the embankment volume. Measurements will be made for unsuitable materials actually excavated and removed to obtain proper compaction in cut sections and in foundations of fill sections in accordance with 1405 203.27\n185 203.27(b). B borrow from off the right-of-way placed within embankment areas will\nbe measured in accordance with 211.09.    (f) Measurement of Borrow\nBorrow will be measured by the cubic yard. Except as otherwise provided herein, 1410\nborrow will be cross-sectioned in its original position before excavation is started,\nagain after it is completed, and the volume computed by the average end area method. No material shall be excavated as borrow until unsuitable material, vegetation, and other perishable matter have been removed and cross-sections taken over the cleared area. None of this removed unacceptable material shall be moved back into the pit 1415\nbefore final sections are taken.   If borrow is obtained from a source where it is impracticable to measure the material in its original position, such material will be measured after being placed in embankment with no allowance made for a compaction factor. The borrow may be 1420\nmeasured in truck beds in accordance with 211.09 for contracts having a proposal quantity less than 500 cu yds. If such source is contemplated, approval shall be\nobtained in writing before this part of the work is started. For quantities less than\n5,000 cu yds, the material may be weighed in accordance with 109.01(b) and converted from pounds shown on the weigh tickets to cubic yards using a factor of 1425\n3,000 lb/cu yd.   If borrow is specified outside the limits of B borrow and if the requirements of the work do not otherwise prohibit, material in accordance with these specifications for B\nborrow may be furnished and placed at the contract unit price for borrow, and 1430\nmeasurement will be in accordance with 211.09. Measurement of borrow in accordance with 211.09 will be limited to nominal quantities outside the limits of structure backfill. The quantity of borrow measured for payment will not exceed the\ntheoretical quantity of B borrow furnished.\n1435\n(g) Measurement of Embankment Foundation Soils Treatment\nMechanical treatment of embankment foundation soils will be measured by the square yard. Chemical treatment of embankment foundation soils will be measured in accordance with 217.  1440\n(h) Measurement of Water for Shale, Shale and Soft Rock Mixtures, or\nSoft Rock  When payment for water for shale is specified in the contract, the water for shale used will be measured by the 1,000 gal. by means of calibrated tanks or distributors, or by means of accurate water meters. When water for shale is not specified as a pay 1445\nitem in the contract, the water for shale that is used will not be measured directly. Such\nmeasurement will be included in the cost of other pay items.\n(i) Lump Sum  If the pay unit for a pay item for excavation is lump sum, no measurement will be 1450\nmade. 203.27\n186\n(j) Measurement of Exploratory Cores\nExploratory cores will be measured by the linear foot of rock core.  1455\n(k) Measurement of Coal Ash\nIf coal ash is used as borrow, it will be measured in accordance with 203.27(f).\nIf coal ash is encountered during excavation, it will be measured as common excavation in accordance with 203.27. 1460\n203.28 Basis of Payment  The accepted quantities of excavation and embankment will be paid for at the contract price per unit of measurement for each of the pay items listed below which is included in the Schedule of Pay Items. Common excavation and unclassified 1465\nexcavation will be paid for on the unit basis of contract quantities in accordance with 203.27(a), without any quantity limit, unless otherwise shown in the Schedule of Pay Items. Combined quantities of borrow, common and unclassified excavation not\nexceeding 15,000 cu yds will be paid for on the basis of contract quantities in\naccordance with 203.27(a) with no adjustment to plan shrinkage factor. Except as 1470\nnoted above, borrow, as well as all other excavation, will be paid for on the basis of measured quantities in accordance with 203.27(b), unless otherwise shown in the Schedule of Pay Items. Linear grading will be paid for at the contract unit price per linear foot.\n1475\nIf the class of excavation is linear grading, additional borrow and the excavation of and disposal of unsuitable material not included as pay items will be paid for as follows:\nIf the total quantity exceeds 5,000 cu yds at a given location, it will be paid for at 1480\n$8.00 per cu yd. If the total quantity exceeds 1,000 cu yds, but does not exceed 5,000 cu yds at a given location, it will be paid for at $12.00 per cu yd. If the total quantity does not exceed 1,000 cu yds at a given location, it will be paid for at $15.00 per  cu yd.  1485\nLinear grading includes only such grading within the construction limits. All grading the Contractor is directed to perform outside the construction limits, except for the Contractor\u2019s convenience, will be paid for in accordance with 104.03 or 109.03 unless such grading is shown on the plans or in the Contract Information book.  1490\nExisting concrete building foundations, concrete walls, concrete columns, or\nconcrete steps not visible and not shown on the plans within the limits of the planned\nexcavation will be paid for at 10 times the contract unit price per cubic yard for common or unclassified excavation, whichever is set out as a pay item. Unless a waste area is established within the contract limits, the minimum pay for this work will be 1495\n$80.00 per cu yd.  203.28\n187  Excavation and disposal of unsuitable material will be paid for at the contract unit\nprice for the class of excavation involved. If no such pay item is included in the contract and embankment is included as a pay item, the excavation and disposal will 1500\nbe paid for at the contract unit price for embankment, unless otherwise directed.\nIf there is no pay item for rock excavation and such is encountered, it will be paid\nfor at $125.00 per cu yd for quantities less than or equal to 100 cu yds. For quantities greater than 100 cu yds pay will be determined in accordance with 104.03. 1505\nIf there is no pay item for common excavation and if such is encountered, it will be paid for at the contract unit price per cubic yard for borrow.\nIf the contract includes a pay item for waterway excavation, and if Class Y 1510\nexcavation is encountered and there is no pay item for such, the Class Y excavation\nwill be paid for at 10 times the contract unit price per cubic yard for waterway excavation, or $100.00 per cu yd, whichever is greater.\nIf the contract does not include a pay item for waterway excavation and such is 1515\nencountered, pay will be determined in accordance with 104.03.   If excavation is necessary to investigate or to seal sinkholes, or to explore underground drainage, the accepted quantity involved at each location will be paid for as follows. The first 10 cu yds or fraction thereof will be paid for at 10 times the 1520\ncontract unit price for the class of excavation encountered. The next 40 cu yds or fraction thereof will be paid for at seven times the contract unit price for the class of excavation involved. Additional quantities will be paid for at three times the contract unit price per cubic yard for the class of excavation involved.  1525\nMaterial overlying the peat deposits which is excavated and used in embankment\nwill be considered as common excavation and will be paid for as such. Excavation for standard side ditches or other side ditches which are constructed through peat areas at locations shown on the plans, or where directed, will be paid for at the contract unit price per cubic yard for common excavation. 1530\nMechanical treatment of embankment foundation soils will be paid for by the square yard as embankment foundation soils treatment.   Cased test holes and exploratory drilling will be paid for at the contract unit price 1535\nper linear foot.\nIf there is no pay item for borrow, the costs of identifying the borrow areas, the\narcheological investigation, all required permits, and the opening and closing of the borrow area will be included in a change order developed in accordance with 109.05 1540\nand paid for as borrow area.

AASHTO T 252\nStructure Backfill, Size No. 30  ................................. 904.05\n\n* Ottawa Sand shall have a minimum permeability of 25 ft/day.\n\nBentonite chips shall consist of commercially processed angular fragments of 20\npure bentonite, without additives. Bentonite-cement grout shall consist of a mixture\nwith the ratio of 25 lb of bentonite to 94 lb of portland cement, Type I in accordance with 901.01(b) and 30 gal. of water.\nCONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS 25\n204.03 Settlement Plates\nSettlement plates consist of 1/2 in. by 3 ft by 3 ft steel plate equipped with sections\nof 3/4 in. pipe and 2 in. galvanized threaded pipe and couplings to act as a cover or\nguard. 30\n(a) Installation Requirements  Each settlement plate shall be placed on a horizontal plane consisting of a\ncompacted leveling layer of B borrow, whose surface is not less than 1 ft below the elevation of the adjacent area. The first section of pipe shall then be installed by 35\nwelding to the settlement plate. The bottom elevation of the settlement plate will be recorded. The area is backfilled with B borrow and thoroughly compacted. The couplings shall be tack welded and the top elevation of the first pipe section will be recorded before starting the first lift of grading operations.  40\nThe pipe sections for the settlement plates shall be 3/4 in. steel pipe, 4 ft long and\nthreaded on both ends with proper fittings so that pipe sections can be extended\nvertically from the center of the plates up through the new embankment as it increases 204.03\n191 in height during grading operations. A cover pipe 2 in. shall be slipped over and\ncentered on the standpipe, and not welded to plates. The 3/4 in. steel and cover pipes 45\nshall extend a minimum of 2 ft or more above the grade of the new embankments at all times during grading operations and monitoring period.\nSettlement stakes and lateral stakes, if required, shall be installed as shown on the\nplans or as directed by the Engineer. The stakes shall be 3/4 in. by 4 ft steel rods and 50\nshall be driven at least 12 in. into the ground. These stakes shall be set firmly in a vertical position and initial readings will be taken.   B borrow shall be used as compaction material around the settlement plates and pipes and shall be placed in accordance with the applicable requirements of 211. 55\n\n(b) Instrument Readings and Settlement Period\nDuring the construction of the embankment, elevation readings will be taken on\nall settlement plate extension pipes and settlement stakes at the end of each seven-day period, or more frequently if required. After the embankment is constructed to the 60\nbottom of the subgrade, additional readings will be taken every seven days until the settlement rate per week is 1/4 in. or less for four consecutive weeks. The monitoring\nperiod may be reduced as directed by the Department\u2019s Geotechnical Engineering\nDivision.  65\nIf the results of any readings indicate that the new embankment has settlement greater than 1/4  in., the monitoring period will be extended until the settlement\nrequirements are met.   Settlement stakes will be used to measure the vertical movement, in conjunction 70\nwith settlement plates if specified. Settlement stakes and settlement plates will be monitored at the same time and interval. Measurements will be made to the nearest 1/4 in. Within one day of the readings, settlement data will be sent electronically to\nthe Department\u2019s Geotechnical Engineering Division and will be subject to approval.\n75\nLateral stakes will be used to monitor horizontal movement of the ground or new fill. If lateral movement is noticed during the construction of the fill, the work will be suspended and the Department\u2019s Geotechnical Engineering Division will be contacted. Measurements will be made to the nearest 1/4 in.  80\nSettlement plates, extension pipes, cover pipes, and stakes shall be protected during construction operations and during the monitoring period.    (c) Protection and Maintenance\nThe settlement stake and settlement plate shall remain in a vertical position. The 85\nContractor shall ensure that settlement plates and settlement stakes are not damaged\nor displaced. Settlement stakes and settlement plates deviating from a vertical position, becoming uncoupled, or broken shall be repaired or replaced by the Contractor, as directed by the Engineer.  90 204.03\n192  The Contractor will not be held responsible for repair or replacement of any\nsettlement plate assembly which is damaged as a result of instability of the embankment caused by factors beyond the control of the Contractor, as determined by the Engineer.  95\n204.04 Standpipe Piezometers\nThe standpipe piezometers shall be installed by a geotechnical consultant on the\nDepartment\u2019s Qualified Geotechnical Consultant\u2019s List prior to placing the first lift of embankment. Piezometer consists of a 1/2 in. leak proof, flush-coupled Schedule 80 PVC pipe or ABS standpipe extending to the surface of the embankment with an 100\nattached polyethylene tip in accordance with AASHTO T 252.\n(a) Installation Requirements  A separate water-monitoring borehole shall be installed outside the influence of\nthe fill as shown on the plans. This shall be a minimum 2 in. diameter borehole, cased 105\nwith slotted pipes, drilled to a recommended depth and location or as directed by the Engineer, to establish groundwater elevation prior to piezometer installation.\n\nThe installation of the standpipe piezometer shall precede placement of any embankment by at least two weeks to allow time for testing of the installation. The 110\npiezometer shall be maintained and protected during the embankment construction. The hollow stem auger shall be advanced to an approximate depth of 6 in. below the recommended piezometer tip elevation. Augers shall be cleaned and washed inside for their full length, until the wash water runs clear.  115\nThe auger shall be withdrawn 6 in. by means of jacking or other steady pull operations. The hole shall be filled to the bottom with saturated Ottawa sand and tamped with an annular tamping hammer. The  elevation shall be measured and\nprovided to the Engineer.\n120\nThe tip shall be attached to the standpipe and tested for free flow of water. The bottom end of the tip shall be plugged and soaked in water if a porous stone tip is used. The tip and standpipe shall be filled with clean water. The tip shall be lowered into the auger until it rests on the top of the sand placed and the elevation of the tip should be documented. Excess head shall be maintained in the standpipe during lowering to 125\nensure that a small amount of water flows out of the tip.   The auger shall then be pulled or jacked a distance equal to the length of the tip in increments of 6 in. The hole shall be filled with water saturated Ottawa sand at each increment. This layer of sand shall not be tamped in order to avoid damage to the tip. 130\n\nThe auger shall be raised 12 in. and the hole filled with saturated Ottawa sand in\n6 in. increments until the backfilling reaches a minimum of 6 in. below the elevation of the strata change or as directed by the Engineer. In locations where there is no strata change, the Ottawa sand shall be placed a minimum of 12 in. above the top of the tip. 135\n204.04\n193  The augers shall then be raised and the hole sealed with bentonite chips in\naccordance with AASHTO T 252 which shall be placed in 6 in. lifts. The top of the seal shall be a minimum of 6 in. above the strata break. A weighted line shall be used to ensure the bentonite seal is in place. The remainder of the hole shall then be 140\nbackfilled with bentonite-cement grout as the augers are withdrawn. The riser pipe\nshall be kept in tension and shall be centered in the auger while backfilling. Depths for\nvarious stages shall be recorded on the Engineer\u2019s logs.   If the piezometer location is not in an area of proposed fill, an approximately 3 ft 145\nlong protective metal cover shall be installed at the top with approximately 2 ft below the surface and 12 in. above the surface. A 12 in. diameter by 6 in. thick circular pad of coarse aggregate shall be filled around the cover. A lockable cap shall be securely attached onto the protective metal cover.  150\nIf the piezometer location is in an area of proposed fill, a PVC casing shall be used around the piezometer standpipe in order to protect the pipes during embankment construction. B borrow shall be placed and compacted around the casing without\ndisturbing the casing.\n155\nThe casing and standpipe shall be extended as the fill is placed by adding extra lengths not to exceed 5 ft. The top of the standpipe shall be at least 12 in. above the grade of the new fill. Each time the casing and standpipe are extended, the casing shall be filled with structure backfill. The last extension of pipe shall be of such length that it extends 12 in. above grade. It shall be filled with structure backfill to within 9 in. of 160\nthe top of the casing. A 12 in. diameter by 6 in. thick circular pad of coarse aggregate shall be filled around the pipes. A lockable cap shall be securely attached onto the protective cover.\nWhen the standpipe is completed, it shall be checked for obstructions by dropping 165\na weighted line through the pipe. The standpipe shall then be filled with water and periodic readings made of the water level until the groundwater level is stabilized. Hydrostatic time lag required for equalization will be provided by the Geotechnical report. If required, the standpipe shall be flushed and retested at the direction of the Engineer. Groundwater readings shall be provided to the Engineer. 170\nStandpipe piezometers, and cover pipes shall be protected during construction operations and during the monitoring of the fill. In the event of damage, fill construction shall be suspended in this area until the piezometer is restored.\n175\n(b) Readings and Maintenance of Piezometer\nThe Engineer will conduct and record all observations and measurements required\nto determine natural groundwater elevations and pore pressures induced by\nembankment construction. Monitoring intervals will be once every day for the first\nseven days, once every other day for the next eight, and then, once every three days 180\nthrough the end of construction of the fill. The elevation of the natural groundwater existing at the time of installation, prior to placement of any fill, will be used as a 204.04\n194 reference to determine baseline pore pressures.

The final elevations shall depend on conditions encountered during\nexcavation, at which time other elevations may be ordered in writing if necessary to\nsecure satisfactory foundations.   Where existing foundation material would not support the contemplated load 115\nsafely, the plans may require, or it may be directed that foundation piles be driven in the footing area. This piling shall be furnished, driven, and paid for in accordance with 701.   206.07 Disposal of Excavated Material 120\nExcept as otherwise herein provided, material excavated for a structure or its approaches, including any material excavated beyond the pay limits of foundation excavation or its specified or approved extensions, shall, if suitable, be used for filling\naround the new structure, for spandrel filling, approach embankment, regular\nembankment, or for any combination of these, all as specified or directed. 125\nIf excavated material, in accordance with 211.02, is required at the structure or in its approaches, then this material shall be used as special fill and placed in accordance 206.06\n218 with the applicable provisions of 211. B borrow consisting of ACBF or GBF shall not\nbe used within 2 ft of the free water level. 130\nSurplus or unsuitable material shall not be disposed of in any manner that would obstruct or pollute the stream or otherwise impair the efficiency or appearance of the\nstructure. If there are piers in the water, permission may be granted to waste excavated\nmaterial adjacent to these piers provided such waste does not obstruct the waterway. 135\nIf usable excavated material is wasted without authority, the quantity so wasted will be deducted from the quantities of common excavation, borrow, or B borrow, depending on the nature of the waste and its use.\nDisposal of surplus or unsuitable material, including Class X excavation, outside 140\nthe right-of-way shall be in accordance with 201.03 and 203.08.   206.08 Preparation of Foundation Surfaces  Excavation for foundations on rock without piles shall extend a minimum of 2 ft into solid rock. All rock or other hard material, if to be left in place as a foundation 145\nsurface, shall be freed of loose material, cleaned, and cut to a firm surface. The final\nsurface shall be level, stepped, or serrated as directed. Seams shall be cleaned and filled with concrete, cement mortar, or grout. These conditions shall prevail when the foundation masonry is placed.  150\nWhere the masonry is to rest on a foundation surface other than those described above, the approximate bottom of the excavation shall not be disturbed. The final removal of material to the required grade shall be done carefully just prior to placing the foundation masonry. The final surface shall be left smooth and, unless otherwise designated, be level. 155\n\nNotification shall be given after final excavation of each foundation is completed.\nNo masonry shall be placed until the depth of the excavation and the character of the foundation material have been approved.  160\nRock at the bottom of spread footings shall be proof-tested. For state-administered\ncontracts, the Department\u2019s Geotechnical Engineering Division shall be contacted prior to proof-testing. For local public agency contracts, the Engineer shall be contacted prior to proof-testing. Proof-testing with a small diameter test hole of a\nminimum 2 in. inside diameter shall be drilled into the foundation base using rotary or 165\npercussive drilling methods. Holes shall be drilled into sound rock to a depth of 5 ft or as directed. Three holes shall be drilled into each foundation base. Observations shall be made at each hole as follows:\n\n1. speed of drilling 170\n2. drill pressure     3. dropping or clogging of drill bit 206.08\n219  175\n4. loss of drill water, if used     5. probing of the sides of the holes with a right angled chisel\npoint. The chisel shall be formed from a rod of 3/8 or 1/2 in.\ndiameter 180\n6. continuity of bearing material\n7. rock quality designation in accordance with\nASTM D6032 185\n\n8. photos of the rock core.   A professional engineer shall supervise the proof testing work. A report for each hole shall be prepared and submitted to the Engineer for review and approval. 190\n\n206.09 Cofferdams and Temporary Construction Dikes\nWorking drawings shall be submitted in accordance with 105.02. They shall show the proposed method of cofferdam construction and other details left open to choice or not fully shown on the plans. 195\nWorking drawings for dikes to be used in lieu of cofferdams or to be used for access to the work shall be submitted in accordance with 105.02, if such dikes are to be constructed within the waterway. Approval of such drawings will only be given if the probability of stream pollution and stream flow restriction is minimal. 200\nCofferdams shall be constructed for all abutments and piers where water or\nunstable soil is encountered or where the soil may become unstable; excessive stream\npollution or stream flow restriction might occur with other construction procedures; or if necessary to support the sides of excavated areas, embankment, adjacent buildings, 205\ntracks, or other premises. In general, they shall be carried down well below bottoms of footings, shall be well braced, and as nearly watertight as practicable. The interior dimensions shall be sufficient to provide ample clearance to enable pile driving, the construction of forms, and clearance for pumping equipment outside the forms. Cofferdams shall be constructed to protect plastic concrete against damage from a 210\nsudden rising of the stream and to prevent damage to the foundation by erosion.   No timber or bracing that would extend into substructure masonry shall be left in cofferdams except with written permission.\n215\nCofferdams which become tilted or moved laterally during the process of sinking shall be righted or enlarged to provide ample clearance. Any necessary correction shall be made with no additional payment.   Except as otherwise provided herein, cofferdams shall be dewatered and sediment 220 206.09\n220 controlled in accordance with 108.04. Pumping will not be allowed for 24 h after\nconcrete placement, unless otherwise approved.   When conditions are encountered under which it is established that no reasonable pumping will dewater the cofferdam when every practicable effort has been made to 225\nreduce the inflow of water, or other conditions are such that a foundation seal is\nnecessary, the construction of a concrete foundation seal may be required of such dimensions as necessary. This seal shall be constructed in accordance with 702.20(f).   Unless otherwise specified, all cofferdam bracing shall be removed and all 230\nsheeting removed or cut off at least 2 ft below the finished ground line, except within\nthe low-water channel where it may either be removed or cut off even with the stream bed. Removal shall be such that the finished masonry will not be marred or disturbed.   206.10 Method of Measurement 235\nStructure excavation, except wet excavation, will be measured in cubic yards in its original position below the limits of roadway excavation. Wet excavation will be\nthe theoretical quantity in accordance with 206.11(b). When structures are to be placed\nin embankment sections, the natural ground line, as cross-sectioned, will be the uppermost level of computation unless otherwise specified or shown on the plans. 240\nClass X material encountered and removed during the excavation of foundations for traffic support structures will be measured to the foundation neat lines as shown\non the plans below the surface of Class X material.  245\nIf the pay unit for any item of excavation in the Schedule of Pay Items is lump sum, no measurement will be made. Extended excavation for footings will be measured to include the entire depth needed for the deeper footing and the entire width\nneeded to comply with OSHA or IOSHA requirements.\n250\n206.11 Basis of Payment  The accepted quantities of structure excavation will be paid for at the contract unit price per cubic yard or lump sum.

If cofferdams are specified as a pay item, they will be paid for at the contract lump sum price for cofferdams. If a foundation seal is constructed, it will be paid for in accordance with 702.28. 260\n\nThe quantity of Class X excavation to be paid for will be the cubic yards of such\nmaterial actually removed from within vertical planes defining the neat lines of the\nfootings, except where material classified as Class X excavation overlays other material which shall be excavated to cofferdam limits. Such overlying strata will be 265 206.11\n221 paid for to the limits of the material excavated beneath it. Unless otherwise provided,\nno additional payment will be made for such excavation made outside these limits.\nIf Class X excavation is encountered and there is no contract unit price for Class X excavation, payment will be made at a unit price per cubic yard as follows: 270\n\n1. $1,000.00 per cu yd if the quantity of Class X excavation\nis less than or equal to 1 cu yd per foundation.\n\n2. When the quantity of Class X excavation is greater than 275\n1 cu yd per foundation, payment will be made at $1,000.00 per cu yd for the quantity up to 1 cu yd.

Payment will be made in accordance with 109.05. 315\n\nAll backfill material or sub-footing material required whose source is other than\nstructure excavation will be paid for at the contract unit price for the material being used or as extra work if no unit price has been established. A change order will be prepared in accordance with 109.05. 320\nThe cost of furnishing all materials and labor associated with proof testing of rock shall be included in the cost of other pay items.   If a borrow area is required and borrow is not specified as a pay item, payment 325\nwill be made in accordance with 203.28.   If a waste area is required and the contract documents do not identify excess\nexcavation or require removal of any items, payment will be made in accordance with\n203.28. 330\nExcept for sign foundations, traffic signal foundations, and highway illumination foundations, if a type of excavation for which no pay item exists is required and the new type of excavation requires the Contractor to use equipment not otherwise being used on the contract, payment will be in accordance with 203.28. 335\nIf a type of excavation for which no pay item exists is required and the new type of excavation requires additional traffic control not shown on the plans or results in traffic control being required for an additional period of time, payment will be made\nin accordance with 203.28. 340\nPayment will be made under:    Pay Item Pay Unit Symbol  345\nCofferdam .........................................................................

If cubic yards are set out as the pay item for B borrow or structure backfill in the Schedule of Pay Items and if neat line limits are not specified for measurement of volume for the material, measurement will be made by the cubic yard at the loading point in truck beds which have been measured, stenciled, and approved.  200\nThe B borrow may be weighed and converted to cubic yards by assuming the weight per cubic foot to be 90% of the maximum wet density in accordance with AASHTO T 99. The material may be cross-sectioned in its original position and again after excavation is complete, and the volume computed by the average end area 205\nmethod.\n\nIf B borrow is used for backfill in areas where unsuitable material is present or peat excavation has been performed, unless otherwise directed, the B borrow will be cross-sectioned, and the volume will be computed by the average end area method. 210\nStructure backfill Type 4 or Type 5 will be measured by the cubic yard as computed from the neat line limits shown on the plans. If neat line limits are not shown on the plans, the volume in cubic yards of flowable backfill furnished and placed as structure backfill Type 4 or Type 5 will be computed from the nominal volume of each 215\nbatch and a count of the batches. Unused and wasted flowable backfill will be estimated and deducted.\nIf the material is to be paid for by the ton, it shall be weighed in accordance with\n109.01(b). 220\nIf the material comes from a wet source such as below water or a washing plant, and weighing is involved in the method of measurement, there shall be a 12 h drainage period prior to the weighing. 211.09\n237  225\nGeotextile will be measured in accordance with 616.12.   211.10 Basis of Payment  The accepted quantities of B borrow will be paid for at the contract unit price per\ncubic yard or per ton as specified, complete in place. 230\nStructure backfill will be paid for at the contract unit price per cubic yard of the type specified, provided the material comes from outside the permanent right-of-way.   B borrow material placed outside the neat lines will be paid for as borrow when 235\nsuch B borrow eliminates required borrow material. Otherwise, no payment will be made for backfill material placed outside the neat lines.   Aggregate for end bent backfill will be paid for at the contract unit price per cubic yard, based on the neat line limits shown on the plans. 240\n\nGeotextile will be paid for in accordance with 616.13.\nIf topsoil, loam, or other suitable material in accordance with 211.05 is used for expediting the growth of seed or sod, it will be paid for at the contract unit price per 245\ncubic yard for borrow, unless otherwise provided.

If the\nmaterial is placed under a joint formed between two mixtures requiring different rates,\nthe lower application rate shall be used.\n\n** A coarse-graded mixture will be defined as a 9.5 mm mixture having less than 47%\npassing the No. 8 (2.36 mm) sieve or a 12.5 mm mixture having less than 39% passing\nthe No. 8 (2.36 mm) sieve.\n\n\nThe application shall be within 2 in. of being centered under the joint of the HMA\ncourse being constructed. When only half of the joint is exposed, the application shall 545\nbe applied at half of the prescribed width, shall be adjacent to the center of the joint,\nand the vertical face of the cold joint left in place shall also be coated.\n\nThe Contractor shall furnish a bill of lading to the Engineer for each tanker\nsupplying material to the project. The flow, application rate, and tracking of material 550\nwill be verified within the first 1,000 ft of the day\u2019s scheduled application length and\nevery 12,000 ft the remainder of the day. For projects less than 3,000 ft, the rate will\nbe verified once. A suitable paper or pan shall be placed at a random location in the\npath of placement. The paper or pan shall be picked up and weighed after application\nto determine the weight per ft yield. The Contractor shall replace the VRAM in the 555\nareas where the samples were taken.\n\nThe VRAM shall be applied in a single pass. A distributor or melting kettle shall\napply the material to within 1 1/2 in. of the width specified. Placement shall stop and\nremedial action shall be taken if the material flows more than 2 in. from initial 560\nplacement. Release paper shall be placed over the previous application to prevent\ndoubling the thickness when starting another run.\n\nThe VRAM shall be suitable for construction traffic to drive on without pickup or\ntracking within 30 minutes of placement. Placement shall stop and damaged areas shall 565\nbe repaired if pickup or tracking occurs. The paver end plate and grade control device\nshall be raised above the finished height of the material prior to start of paving.\n\nCores for density determination shall be in accordance with 401.16 and 401.20\nand shall not be taken within 12 in. of either the confined edge or the non-confined 570\nedge of the course placed where VRAM has been applied. 401.15\n317\n401.16 Density\nAcceptance will be based on lots and sublots in accordance with 401.07.  575\nDensity of the compacted dense graded mixture will be determined from cores\nexcept where:\n(a) the total planned lay rate to be placed over a shoulder existing\nprior to the contract award is less than 385 lb/sq yd, or 580\n(b) the first lift of material placed at less than 385 lb/sq yd over a\nshoulder existing prior to the contract award.\nDensity of any random core location in these areas will be assigned a value of 585\n94.0% MSG and compaction shall be in accordance with 402.15.   Open graded mixtures shall be compacted with six passes of a static tandem roller\nand will be assigned a value of 84.0% MSG. Vibratory rollers shall not be used on\nopen graded mixtures. 590\nCompaction of 4.75 mm mixtures shall be in accordance with 402.15, except vibratory rollers shall be operated in static mode and the vertical impact force capability of oscillatory rollers shall not be used.  595\nCompaction of mixtures with original contract pay item quantities less than 300 t shall be in accordance with 402.15.   Density acceptance by cores will be based on samples obtained from two random\nlocations selected by the Engineer within each sublot in accordance with ITM 802. 600\nOne core shall be cut at each random location in accordance with ITM 580. The transverse core location will be located so that the edge of the core will be no closer than 3 in. from a confined edge or 6 in. from a non-confined edge of the course being placed. The maximum specific gravity will be determined from the samples obtained in 401.09. 605\nThe Contractor shall obtain cores in the presence of the Engineer with a device that shall produce a uniform 6.00 \u00b10.25 in. diameter pavement sample. Coring shall\nbe completed prior to the random location being covered by the next course.  610\nAll core locations will be marked and shall be cored within two workable days of\nplacement. A damaged core shall be discarded and replaced with a core from a location\nselected by adding 1 ft to the longitudinal location of the damaged core using the same transverse offset.  615\nThe Contractor and the Engineer shall mark the core to define the course to be tested. If the core indicates a course thickness of less than two times the maximum 401.16\n318 particle size, the core will be discarded and a core from a new random location will be\nselected for testing.  620\nCores shall not be obtained from the following areas:\n(a) Mixture placed on an approach, taper, gore area, crossover that\nis not placed simultaneously with the mainline.\n625\n(b) Mixture placed on a shoulder less than 8 ft in width that is not\nplaced simultaneously with the mainline.\n(c) Within 25 ft of a transverse construction joint.  630\n(d) Within 25 ft of an acceptance sample taken in accordance with\n401.09.\n(e) Areas placed with paving equipment in accordance with\n409.03(c)2 or 409.03(c)3. 635\nIf a random location falls within this area, the Engineer will randomly select another location within the sublot for coring. If an entire sublot falls within this area, test results from the previous sublot will be used for acceptance. If the previous sublot is not available, the subsequent sublot will be used for acceptance. 640\nThe Engineer will take immediate possession of the cores. If the Engineer\u2019s cores are subsequently damaged, additional coring will be the responsibility of the Department. Subsequent core locations will be determined by subtracting 1 ft from the random location using the same transverse offset. 645\n\nThe density for the mixture will be expressed as:\nDensity, % =BSG\nMSG\nx 100\nwhere: 650\nBSG = average bulk specific gravity\nMSG = maximum specific gravity.   Samples for the bulk specific gravity and maximum specific gravity will be dried in accordance with ITM 572. The Engineer will determine the bulk specific gravity of 655\nthe cores in accordance with AASHTO T 166, Method A or AASHTO T 331, if required. The maximum specific gravity will be mass determined in water in accordance with AASHTO T 209.\nWithin one workable day of coring operations, the Contractor shall clean, dry, and 660\nrefill the core holes with either HMA of similar or smaller size particles or bridge deck repair material from the QPL of Rapid Setting Patch Materials.

The inertial profiler shall remain the property of the Contractor.   The project area will be divided into individual smoothness sections measuring 0.1 mi in length for each lane. The paving exceptions and areas exempt from inertial 700\nprofiler operation will be in accordance with ITM 917.\nIf the posted speed limit for an entire smoothness section is less than or equal to\n45 mph, the section will be exempt from Inertial Profiler operation and the smoothness within the section will be accepted in accordance with 401.18(b). 705\nIf the posted speed limit is greater than 45 mph for a portion of a smoothness section and is less than or equal to 45 mph for the remainder, the section smoothness 401.17\n320 acceptance will be as follows:\n710\n1. By inertial profiler for the portion of the section with a\nposted speed limit greater than 45 mph.\n2. In accordance with 401.18(b) for the portion of the section\nwith a posted speed limit less than or equal to 45 mph.\n715\nAt locations where the inertial profiler is required, it shall be used on the surface course and on any dense graded intermediate course immediately below the surface course.    (b) 16 ft Straightedge 720\nThe Contractor shall furnish and operate a 16 ft straightedge in accordance with\n306.03(d) and as described below. The 16 ft straightedge shall be used to measure smoothness along the direction of mainline traffic.    Locations on the pavement surface scraped by the straightedge shall be marked. 725\nThe pavement shall be corrected in accordance with 401.18(e) to meet the required\ntolerance. For existing utility and manhole castings that required no grade adjustment, the tolerance may be adjusted after being reviewed and approved by the Engineer.   For contracts which include the Inertial Profiler, HMA pay item, the 16 ft 730\nstraightedge or the Inertial Profiler simulating the 16 ft straightedge shall be used to measure longitudinal smoothness on surface courses at the following locations:     1. All mainline traveled way lanes shorter than 0.5 mi.    2. All mainline traveled way lanes at locations exempted from 735\ninertial profiler operation in accordance with ITM 917.\n3. All mainline traveled way lanes within smoothness\nsections with posted speed limits less than or equal to 45 mph throughout the entire section length.\n4. All tapers. 740\n5. All ramps.    6. All turn lanes, including bi-directional left turn lanes\nshorter than 0.5 mi.\n7. All acceleration and deceleration lanes associated with\nramps with posted speeds of 45 mph or less. 745\n8. All shoulders.    9. All intersections with significant change in cross slope.\n\nFor contracts where the inertial profiler is not used for smoothness acceptance,\nthe 16 ft straightedge shall be used to measure longitudinal smoothness on all surface 750\ncourses, and on any dense graded intermediate course immediately below the surface course. Measurement with the 16 ft straightedge shall include the above locations, all mainline traveled way lanes and ramps with posted speeds greater than 45 mph, and on ramp acceleration or deceleration lanes. 401.18\n321  755\n(c) 10 ft Straightedge\nThe 10 ft straightedge will be in accordance with 306.03(d). The 10 ft straightedge will be used to check transverse slopes, ac ross travel lanes and shoulders, approaches,\nand crossovers. When the 10 ft straightedge is used, the pavement variations shall be\ncorrected to 1/8 in. or less. 760\n(d) Areas of Localized Roughness, ALR\nAt locations where the inertial profiler is being used on an intermediate course, all areas having a localized roughness in excess of 160 in./mi utilizing continuous IRI with a 25 ft window shall be corrected subject to approval by the Engineer. 765\nAt locations where the inertial profiler is being used on a surface course, all areas under category Type A, as defined in 401.19(c), having a localized roughness in excess of 160 in./mi or category Type B in excess of 170 in./mi utilizing continuous IRI with a 25 ft window shall be corrected subject to approval by the Engineer. After ALR's 770\nhave been identified, a grinding simulation shall be performed to estimate whether the\nALR can be corrected to an IRI value of less than 160 in./mi with no more than a\n1/4 in. max grind depth at any spot. If such correction is not possible, then an ALR with an IRI value of less than 190 in./mi can remain uncorrected if approved by the Engineer, and an ALR with an IRI value greater than 190 in./mi shall require full depth 775\nremoval and replacement of the surface course of sufficient area to meet specifications.   In addition, if there is only one ALR in any two lane mile section, then no smoothness correction will be required if the ALR does not exceed 190 in./mi and the\noverall smoothness in accordance with 401.19(c) of the two lane mile section does not 780\nrequire any corrective action. A two lane mile section will start one mile before the ALR and end one mile after the ALR in order that all two lane mile sections will have,\nat most, one ALR each.\n(e) Smoothness Section Correction 785\nThe width of the corrected area may be partial or full lane width, depending on the respective wheel path profiles. Underlying courses that are exposed by corrective action shall be milled to a depth of 1 1/2 in. and replaced with surface course. After the corrective action is taken on a surface course, the inertial profiler shall be operated throughout the entire affected smoothness section to verify the adequacy of the 790\ncorrective action.   At locations where the 16 ft straightedge is used, the pavement variations shall be corrected to 1/4 in. or less.\n795\nIf grinding of an intermediate course is used for pavement smoothness corrections, the grinding shall not precede the surface placement by more than 30 calendar days if open to traffic.  401.18\n322  401.19 Pay Factors 800\n(a) Dense Graded Mixture \u0095 One Lot\nPay factors, PF, are calculated for the air voids at N\ndes, Vbe at N des and in-place\ndensity, %Gmm.

Rounding will be in accordance with 109.01(a).   Density acceptance for all SMA mixtures shall be based on cores cut from the compacted pavement and analysis of pavement samples obtained in accordance with 430\nITM 580. Acceptance will be based on lots and sublots in accordance with 410.07. The Engineer will randomly select two locations in accordance with ITM 802, within each sublot for coring. The transverse core location will be located so that the edge of the core will be no closer than 3 in. from a confined edge or 6 in. from a non-confined edge of the course being placed. The maximum specific gravity will be determined 435\nfrom the sample obtained in 410.09.\n\nThe Contractor shall obtain cores in the presence of the Engineer with a device that shall produce a uniform 6.00 \u00b10.25 in. diameter pavement sample. Surface courses\nshall be cored within one workable day of placement. Damaged core shall be discarded 440\nand replaced with a core from a location selected by adding 1 ft to the longitudinal location of the damaged core using the same transverse offset.   The Contractor and the Engineer shall mark the core to define the course to be tested. If the core indicates a course thickness of less than two times the maximum 445\nparticle size, the core will be discarded and a core from a new random location will be selected for testing.\n\nCores shall not be obtained from areas placed with paving equipment in accordance with 409.03(c)2 or 409.03(c)3. If a random location falls within this area, 450\nthe Engineer will randomly select another location within the sublot for coring. If an entire sublot falls within this area, test results from the previous sublot will be used for acceptance. If the previous sublot is not available, the subsequent sublot will be used for acceptance.  455\nThe Engineer will take immediate possession of the cores. If the Engineer\u2019s cores are subsequently damaged, additional coring within a specific sublot or sublots will be the responsibility of the Department. Subsequent core locations will be determined by subtracting 1 ft from the random location using the same transverse offset.\n460\nThe density of the mixture will be expressed as:\nDensity, % =  BSG\nMSG\nx 100\nwhere: 410.16\n365    BSG = average bulk specific gravity 465\nMSG = maximum specific gravity   Samples for the bulk specific gravity and maximum specific gravity will be dried in accordance with ITM 572. The Engineer will determine the bulk specific gravity of\nthe cores in accordance with AASHTO T 166, Method A or AASHTO T 331, if 470\nrequired.

For existing utility and manhole castings that required no grade adjustment, 455\nthe tolerance may be adjusted after being reviewed and approved by the Engineer.\n\nFor contracts which include the Inertial Profiler, PCCP pay item, the 16 ft straightedge or the Inertial Profiler simulating the 16 ft straightedge shall be used to measure longitudinal smoothness at the following locations: 460\n1. All mainline traveled way lanes shorter than 0.5 mi.     2. All mainline traveled way lanes at locations exempted from\ninertial profiler operation in accordance with ITM 917. 465\n3. All mainline traveled way lanes within smoothness sections\nwith posted speed limits less than or equal to 45 mph\nthroughout the entire section length.\n470\n4. All tapers.\n5. All ramps.     6. All turn lanes, including bi-directional left turn lanes 475\nshorter than 0.5 mi.\n7. All acceleration and deceleration lanes associated with\nramps with posted speeds of 45 mph or less.\n480\n8. All shoulders.     9.

Measurement with the 16 ft straightedge shall include the above locations, all mainline traveled way\nlanes and ramps with posted speeds greater than 45 mph, and on ramp acceleration or\ndeceleration lanes.  490\n(c) 10 ft Straightedge\nThe 10 ft straightedge will be in accordance with 306.03(d). The 10 ft straightedge will be used to check transverse slopes across traveled way lanes and shoulders,\napproaches, and crossovers. When the 10 ft straightedge is used, the pavement\nvariations shall be corrected to 1/8 in. or less. 495\n(d) Areas of Localized Roughness, ALR\nAt locations where the inertial profiler is used, all areas having a localized 501.25\n418 roughness in excess of 160 in./mi utilizing continuous IRI with a 25 ft window shall\nbe corrected subject to approval by the Engineer. After ALRs have been identified, a 500\ngrinding simulation shall be performed to estimate whether the ALR can be corrected to an IRI value of less than 160 in./mi with no more than a 1/4 in. maximum grind depth at any spot. If such correction is not possible, then an ALR with an IRI value of\nless than 190 in./mi can remain uncorrected if approved by the Engineer, and an ALR\nwith an IRI value greater than 190 in./mi shall require full depth removal and 505\nreplacement of sufficient area to meet specifications.   In addition, if there is only one ALR in any two-lane mile section, then no smoothness correction will be required if the ALR does not exceed 190 in./mi and the overall smoothness in accordance with 501.25(d) of the two-lane mile section does not 510\nrequire any corrective action. A two-lane mile section will start one mile before the ALR and end one mile after the ALR in order that all two-lane mile sections will have, at most, one ALR each.    (e) Smoothness Section Correction 515\nPavement smoothness variations outside specified tolerances shall be corrected\nby grinding with a groove type cutter or by replacement. Grinding will not be allowed until the PCCP is 10 days old and flexural strength testing yields a modulus of rupture of 550 psi or greater. The grinding of the pavement to correct the profile shall be accomplished in either the longitudinal or the transverse direction. The PCCP texture 520\nafter grinding shall be uniform. If the grinding operation reduces the tining grooves to a depth of less than 1/16 in. and the longitudinal length of the removal area exceeds 15 ft, or two or more areas are within 30 ft of each other, the PCCP shall be retextured in accordance with 504.03.  525\nThe width of the corrected area may be partial or full lane width, depending on\nthe respective wheel path profiles. After the corrective action is complete, the inertial\nprofiler shall be operated throughout the entire affected smoothness section to verify the adequacy of the corrective action.\n530\nAt locations where the 16 ft straightedge is used, the pavement variations shall be\ncorrected to 1/4 in. or less.\n501.26 Pavement Thickness\nPCCP thickness shall be determined after all corrective grinding. The Contractor 535\nshall obtain cores at the locations determined by the Engineer in accordance with ITM 802. Cores, 4 in. in diameter, shall be taken in the presence of the Engineer for the full depth of the PCCP. The Engineer will take immediate possession of the cores.

Modulus of rupture will be calculated as follows:\n\n\u00bb\u00bc\u00ba\n\u00ab\u00ac\u00aa\u000e\n2A2A\n1A1A\nD DS2F\nS2F x  S F  725\n\nwhere:\nFD =  modulus of rupture of the disputed sublot\nFA1 =  modulus of rupture of the previous ad jacent sublot\nFA2 =  modulus of rupture of the subsequent ad jacent sublot\nSD =  split tensile stren gth of the disputed sublot\nSA1 =  split tensile stren gth of the previous ad jacent sublot\nSA2 =  split tensile stren gth of the subsequent ad jacent sublot.\n\n2. Air Content\nDisputes over the acceptance test results will not be considered unless QC test 730\nresults indicate greater than a 0.5% difference between the Department\u2019s and the Contractor\u2019s tests. Once additional testing has been approved, the Contractor shall obtain core as directed in the presence of the Engineer.\nThe Engineer will determine the location of the core within the disputed sublot. 735\nThe location of the core will be at the center of a lane at the acceptance sample location. A core shall not be taken over dowels or within 5 ft of a header. One 4 in. diameter\nfull depth core shall be taken from the pavement for each sublot disputed. All core holes shall be filled with PCC or rapid setting patch material within 24 h of drilling.  740\nThe air content for a sublot will be the hardened concrete air content determined from the core in accordance with ITM 401. When ACBF aggregates are used, the hardened concrete air content will be determined in accordance with ASTM C457.\n\n(b) Smoothness 745\nThe Department will perform annual QA reviews of a portion of each Contractor\u2019s\nMRI results in accordance with ITM 917. The Contractor\u2019s results will be compared to the Department\u2019s. The Department will notify the Contractor of unacceptable results\nin a timely manner. If the Contractor disputes the results, the Department will allow a\ndispute period of 14 days during which time the Contractor shall submit a written 750 501.29\n426 request and additional MRI results for Department review. If the Contractor\u2019s\nadditional MRI results do not agree with the Department\u2019s results, the Contractor shall\nperform a side-by-side evaluation. The Department\u2019s results will be utilized for\nsmoothness payment in place of the Contractor\u2019s results unless the Contractor\u2019s\nadditional MRI results are determined to be acceptable for payment. Sections where 755\ncorrective action has taken place prior to the Department\u2019s data collection will utilize\nthe Contractor\u2019s initial results prior to corrective action for payment.   501.30 Method of Measurement  QC/QA-PCCP will be measured by the square yard of the thickness specified. The 760\narea of QC/QA-PCCP will be the planned width of the pavement multiplied by the length of the pavement, or as directed in writing. The width of the pavement will be as shown on the typical cross-section of the plans. The length of the pavement will be measured parallel to the surface of the pavement along the centerline of the roadway or ramp, excluding paving exceptions as shown on the plans. 765\nMilled pavement corrugations will be measured in accordance with 606.02.\n\n501.31 Basis of Payment  The accepted quantities of QC/QA-PCCP will be paid for at the contract unit price 770\nper square yard for the thickness specified, complete in place.

Any location deficient in thickness by 1/4 in. or more shall be corrected prior to placing PCCP. 410\n(b) Average PCCP Thickness\nThe thickness of the PCCP for each section shall be the average lengths of all cores from the section. However, no cores shall be included from areas for which no payment will be made. Where PCCP has been removed and replaced, the initial core 415\nlengths will be discarded and the core lengths of the replaced PCCP will be substituted. Any core measurements exceeding the specified PCCP thickness by more than 1/2 in. will be recorded as the specified PCCP thickness plus 1/2 in. Calculations shall be to\nthe nearest 0.1 in.\n420\n(c) PCCP Adjusted Payment  If the average PCCP thickness is equal to or greater than the specified thickness, no adjustments will be made.

Payment for PCCP with non-adjacent cores indicating a thickness deficiency of more than 1/2 in. will be in accordance with 502.21(c). 435\n\nThe limits of non-payment shall extend from deficient core to the transverse joint location nearest the first additional core indicating a thickness deficiency of less than 1/2 in.  440\n(e) PCCP Removal\nWhere two adjacent cores indicate a thickness deficiency of more than 1 in., the\nPCCP shall be removed and replaced. Non-adjacent cores indicating a thickness deficiency of more than 1 in. do not require removal and replacement.  445\nThe limits of removal and replacement shall extend from the deficient core to the transverse joint location nearest the first additional core indicating a thickness\ndeficiency of less than 1/2 in.\n502.22 Method of Measurement 450\nPCCP will be measured by the square yard of the thickness specified. The area of PCCP will be the planned width of the pavement multiplied by the length of the pavement, or as directed in writing. The width of the pavement will be as shown on the typical cross-section of the plans. The length of the pavement will be measured parallel to the surface of the pavement along the centerline of the roadway or ramp, 455\nexcluding paving exceptions as shown on the plans.   Milled pavement corrugations will be measured in accordance with 606.04.\n\n502.23 Basis of Payment 460\nThe accepted quantities of PCCP will be paid for at the contract unit price per\nsquare yard for the thickness specified, complete in place.   Adjustments to the contract payment with respect to thickness will be included in a quality assurance adjustment pay item in accordance with 109.05.1. 465\nMilled pavement corrugations will be paid for in accordance with 606.05.

Payment for pavement thickness determinations will be made at the contract lump sum price for coring, PCCP in accordance with 501.31. A change order in accordance 475\nwith 109.05 will be developed to adjust the cost of PCCP when the final PCCP quantity 502.22\n438 differs from the bid quantity by more than 2,400 sq yds. This adjustment covers the\ncost of cores for the adjusted quantity of PCCP. The adjustment, plus or minus, will be based on the difference in the number of subsections, rounded to the nearest full subsection, times $100. 480\n\nPayment will be made under:\nPay Item Pay Unit Symbol  485\nPCCP, __________ in. ....................................................... SYS\nthickness\nNo additional payment will be made for PCCP which has an average thickness above that shown on the plans. 490\nThe cost of trial batch demonstrations shall be included in the cost of PCCP.\n\nThe cost of corrections for pavement smoothness and retexturing shall be included\nin the cost of PCCP. 495\n\nRemoval and replacement of PCCP found to be deficient or damaged by freezing\nshall be completed with no additional payment.\nThe cost of coring and refilling of the pavement holes for disputing original test 500\nresults and traffic control expenditures related to coring operations shall be included\nin the cost of PCCP."

The operations shall be controlled so that an excess of mortar and water is not worked to the top. Long-handled floats may be used to smooth and fill in open textured areas in the 20\nPCCP.   Hand methods of finishing may be used when finishing equipment breaks down or in tight working areas where field conditions limit the use of mechanical devices. Hand placed concrete shall be further finished by means of a longitudinal float or a 25\ntransverse smoothing float in accordance with 508.08(a).\nThe edges of formed PCCP adjacent to HMA or compacted aggregate shall be\ntooled. A continuous radius with a uniform smooth dense mortar finish shall be\nproduced. 30\n\n(b) Surface Texturing\nThe PCCP surface shall be textured with a double thickness burlap drag or a\nminimum 4 ft wide turf drag followed by tining oriented either longitudinal or\ntransverse to the direction of travel as specified herein, all before the PCCP 35\npermanently sets. The PCCP surface of mailbox approaches and private and\ncommercial driveways shall be broom finished before the PCCP permanently sets.\n\nTining the textured surface shall be completed using a mechanical device in\naccordance with 508.06. The Contractor shall oversee the tining operation to ensure 40\nthe forming of straight, uniform grooves in the textured, plastic PCCP surface without\ntearing the concrete surface, without allowing the tine groove edges to slump at the\nedges, and without bringing pieces of the coarse aggregate to the top of the PCCP\nsurface. Wander and overlap of the tining, and any wavy pattern in the tining shall be\nprevented. Presence of wander, overlap, or wavy pattern in the tining will be cause for 45\nretexturing.\n\nFor tight working areas, form work, and where field conditions such as small or\nirregularly shaped areas limit the use of mechanical devices, as determined by the\nEngineer, the Contractor may request to use a hand tool that is in accordance with 50\n508.06 and has tines and spacing in accordance with 504.03(b)1 or 2 below, as\napplicable for the application.\n\nTexturing and curing operations may be performed by a single machine subject\nto satisfactory performance. 55\n504.03\n447    1. Longitudinal Tining\nTining shall be in the longitudinal direction, parallel with the direction of travel,\non all PCCP that is uniform in width, including mainline and shoulders. Tining shall\nbe completed using a mechanical device in accordance with 508.06 that has 1/8 in. 60\nwide tines, spaced at 3/4 in. center-to-center, and produces a uniform, nominal depth\ntine groove 1/8 in. \u00b11/16 in. deep in the plastic PCCP. The mechanical device shall be\nable to tine the full width of the PCCP in one operation. Tining shall be completed\nprior to the application of curing materials.

Concrete produced at a plant shall be batched within\nthe proportioning tolerances of 502.10. An ACI-Certified Concrete Field Testing 506.05\n457 Technician, Grade I shall be on site to direct all sampling and testing. The trial batch 280\nshall be produced at the plant prior to production.   A sufficient number of flexural strength test beams shall be made and will be\ntested to demonstrate that opening to traffic strength is achieved at an age consistent\nwith the proposed range of usage of the mixture. At a minimum, flexural strength gain 285\nwill be determined at the target opening to traffic times and at the specified 24 h and 3 day targets as specified by the respective mix criteria. The Engineer will test the concrete\u2019s air content, determine the water/cementitious ratio, and prepare and test flexural beams. The flexural strength will be determined by averaging a minimum of two beam breaks. The Department will provide the apparatus to test the beams for 290\nflexural strength.    Personnel shall be provided to assist the Department in casting, curing, and testing the beams. The Engineer will provide the Contractor the results of the tests. The Contractor shall submit, along with the CMDS, all supporting test results for approval 295\nto the DTE prior to placing concrete.

Concrete and necessary labor for sampling shall be furnished as required by the Engineer. Testing for air content and relative yield will be on the first load of the day and once 315\nper every 50 cu yds.    (a) Beams for Validation of CMDP\nAt least one set, consisting of two beams per set, will be made once per every\n150 cu yds of concrete placed and tested for compliance with either the 3-day or 7-day 320\nflexural strength requirements in accordance with 506.04(b) or 502.04(a) respectively,\nfor the purpose of CMDP validation. Air content and relative yield will be measured on each sample of concrete from which beams are made.    Beams for validation shall be placed on the concrete pavement or shoulder 325 506.06\n458 adjacent to the patch and cured in a similar manner as the patch in accordance with\n505.01(a) until patch area is open to traffic. At which point the beams shall be relocated off-site and standard cured in accordance with AASHTO T 23, Section 10.1.2 with the\nexception that the water does not need to be saturated with calcium hydroxide until the 3-day or 7-day time period has elapsed. 330\n\nFailure of the validation beams to meet or exceed the 3-day or 7-day flexural strength requirements specified herein will result in the use of the CMDP being suspended until the Department concludes an investigation into why the failure occurred. If the CMDP is subsequently shown to be acceptable, another set of 335\nvalidation beams will be tested on the next use of the CMDP.    (b) Beams for Opening to Traffic  Additional beams shall be cast for the purpose of opening to traffic for concrete meeting the requirements of 506.04(a) or 506.04(b).

The Contractor shall be prepared to discuss the following:\n(a) work schedule,    (b) traffic control plan, 255\n\n(c) equipment calibration and adjustments,    (d) inspection and evaluation of the condition and adequacy of\nequipment, including units for transport of materials, 260\n(e) CMDP,\n(f) the Contractor\u2019s daily rate of production per work crew, and\n265\n(g) QCP.\n\n509.08 PCCP Removal\nPCCP removal areas for partial depth repairs will be determined by sounding and will be marked. The Contractor shall remove all concrete to the limits shown on the 270\nplans or as directed by the Engineer.    A machine configured to safely and consistently mill the necessary profile as detailed on the plans shall be provided. The teeth on the milling head shall be spaced at either 1/2 in. or 5/8 in. The milling machine shall be approved by the Engineer prior 275\nto the start of milling operations. Whenever possible, the rotating axis of the milling head shall operate perpendicular to the joint being repaired. Should PCCP removal be confined to one side of a joint, the milling machine shall not cause damage to the\nadjacent pavement.\n280\nUnless otherwise approved by the Engineer, areas that are less than 1 sq ft shall be removed by saw cutting and chipping. The saw cutting shall be to a depth of 2 in. within the marked area. Overlapping saw cuts at the outer perimeter of the repair shall not extend more than 2 in. beyond the intersection. Removal of the concrete within the limits of the saw cuts shall be by hand chipping tools or handheld mechanically driven 285\nequipment.    Mechanical hammers may be used to remove the concrete inside the area delineated by the saw cuts but shall not be heavier than a nominal 35 lb class. Mechanically driven tools shall be operated at a maximum angle of 45\u00b0 from the PCCP 290\nsurface. A jack hammer with a wide chisel bit shall be used at a distance of 2 in. from\nthe saw cut to remove the vertical edge and create a taper similar to the milling operations.   Removal areas within JRCP are not required to utilize milling to initiate partial 295\ndepth repairs. Saw cutting and hand chipping may be used as described above. Any 509.08\n483 wire mesh reinforcement exposed during the removal operations shall be removed.\nPCCP removal areas shall not remain open overnight unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. Shoulders or adjacent PCCP damaged during the removal operations 300\nshall be repaired as directed.\n\nMilling, or sawing and hand chipping, is allowed for transverse joint repairs that intersect a longitudinal joint that has already undergone partial depth joint repair. Removal areas along a longitudinal joint shall not disturb a transverse joint that has 305\nalready undergone partial joint repair in accordance with this specification.    Prior to any transverse joint repair that intersects a previous longitudinal repair, the existing partial depth repair along the longitudinal joint shall have achieved at least 12 h of curing, a passing soundness inspection, and adequate strength, as defined in 310\n509.17.    If there is no need for the transverse joint repair to completely cross the\nlongitudinal joint, milling operations along the transverse joint shall stop short of the\nlongitudinal joint so as not to cause damage beyond the longitudinal joint. Sawing and 315\nhand chipping shall be used to complete the removal process up to the longitudinal joint.    Longitudinal joint repairs shall be terminated 12 in. or more from a transverse joint. 320\nThe Engineer will check milled surfaces after PCCP removal to identify any unsound concrete that remains. Limits of the removal area will be identified by sounding with a rock hammer. Areas of unsound concrete will be marked and shall be\nremoved with a chipping hammer. Removal of unsound concrete below the elevation 325\nof the tops of dowel bars or tie bars is not intended and unsound concrete shall remain in place in these areas. For transverse joints, any voids or significant surface irregularities resulting from the hand chipping operations that extend below the elevation of the top of the dowel bars shall be filled using hand placed clean sand to make a uniform, level, bedding material to support the joint filler. For longitudinal 330\njoints, void space below the elevation of the top of tie bars shall be filled with repair concrete.   Dowel bars shall not be damaged during the removal of unsound concrete. At locations where a transverse joint meets the edge of pavement, or where joints 335\nintersect, the Engineer will determine if the concrete is deteriorated for the entire\ndepth, within the limits detailed on the plans for bottom-half joint repair. If either end\nof a dowel bar is exposed or misaligned in a bottom-half joint repair, the exposed portion shall be removed or cut flush with the concrete surface, as directed by the Engineer.  340\nIf the combination of removal for partial depth joint repair and bottom-half joint 509.08\n484 repair exposes more than two adjacent dowels at a contraction joint, the Engineer shall\nbe notified to determine if full depth patching is to be conducted in accordance with 506.08(b). 345\nIf a snowplowable RPM is to be installed in an area of partial depth joint repair,\nthe width of the removal area, in proximity to where the RPM is to be installed, may\nbe increased to provide the necessary clearances as specified in 509.16.  350\n509.09 Surface Preparation and Joint Filler Installation  The milled or hand chipped cavities shall be prepared to provide a clean, irregular surface for the development of a good bond between the joint repair concrete and the existing pavement.   355\nBroken concrete pieces shall be removed and the cavities shall be swept clean. The surface of the cavity shall be thoroughly sandblasted and cleaned with compressed air to remove all dust and chips. Cleaning with compressed air shall be performed as close to placing the concrete as possible, but not after installing any joint filler. If joint\nfiller material has been installed, the surface may be cleaned again by using 360\ncompressed air at low pressure to not damage the in-place filler or sand below the top of any exposed dowel bar just prior to placing the grout or concrete. The air lines for sandblasting and compressed air cleaning shall be equipped with oil traps to prevent contamination of the surfaces.  365\n(a) Joint Filler - General Requirements\nThe installation of joint filler is required before concrete placement and shall be of a width that matches the existing transverse or longitudinal joint being repaired or\na minimum width of 3/8 in., whichever is greater. The joint filler shall extend at least 3 in. beyond the length of the patch area. Joint filler shall be installed as one piece for 370\nthe depth of the repair. Splicing long lengths of joint filler may be allowed. The method\nof splicing shall be as approved by the Engineer.    (b) Joint Filler at Transverse Joints and Bottom Half Repairs\nUse of joint filler is required for establishing compression relief at all existing 375\ntransverse D-1 contraction joints and along both the longitudinal and transverse joint sides of a bottom-half repair.   The joint filler shall not only re-establish the joint within the repair but shall also prevent the infiltration of the concrete into and across the crack or joint. Prior to 380\nplacement of the joint filler at a transverse contraction joint, the joint shall be tooled or widened sufficiently at the bottom of the repair to create a slot so that the joint filler\ncan be inserted a minimum of 1/4 in. below the bottom of the repair concrete. The base\nof the slot shall not extend below the elevation of the top of any exposed dowel bar. Joint filler shall be cut or trimmed to match the irregularities of the concrete at the 385\nbottom of the slot. Duct tape shall be placed as a bond breaker on exposed dowel bars.   509.09\n485  Any void space that exists below the top of exposed dowels shall be filled with\nclean No. 23 natural sand that is sufficiently dry to flow into the gap.  390\n(c) Longitudinal Joints\nJoint repairs at longitudinal joints shall utilize either a joint filler to re-establish\nthe joint or perform both of the following:\n1. Tool the plastic repair concrete after placement to create a 395\nweak plane at the original joint location. The joint tooling equipment shall be identified in the QCP. Tooling of the joint may be eliminated if the concrete used in the patch has been verified by the Engineer as meeting the shrinkage requirements stated in 509.04. 400\n2. Saw the joint after the repair concrete has adequately\nhardened. Sawing of the tooled joint shall be performed with a 1/4 in. blade. Sawing shall be done with care as soon\nas possible without causing excessive raveling of the repair 405\nmaterial. The depth of the saw cut shall extend below the full depth of the repair by at least 1/4 in., but no closer than 1 in. above the tie bar. If it is determined that a crack forms at the bottom of the tooled joint before sawing can be performed without raveling, sawing to re-establish the joint 410\nshall not be performed.\nAreas designated by the Engineer as requiring bottom-half joint repair shall be prepared as shown on the plans. The reinforcing bars shall be installed in accordance with 503.03(g). 415\n\n509.10 Concrete Mixing and Transportation  For onsite weighing and batching of OPCC or RHCC, the appropriate number of pre-packaged bags of cement, shall be at the mixing site to accommodate the day\u2019s production. The fine and coarse aggregate shall be pre-weighed to within 2 % of their 420\ntarget for the batch size and placed in appropriate containers. Each aggregate component for a batch shall be identified as to material and weight, to facilitate accurate batching into the mixer in the proper sequence.   Water, air-entraining agent, and chemical admixtures, if appropriate, shall be at 425\nthe mixing site. The water necessary to provide the required slump shall be measured by weight or volume and recorded for each batch. All components of cement,\naggregates, water, air-entraining agent, and any organic retarder shall be charged into\na paddle type mixer according to the sequence defined in the QCP and mixed for a minimum of five minutes. The location of mixing shall be on the job site in close 430\nproximity to the joint repair operations.   Prepackaged concrete, CPM 3U18, and an air-entraining admixture, may be used 509.10\n486 instead of batching individual components. Pre-packaged concrete, CPM 3U58, shall\nnot be modified with admixtures. 435\nA prepackaged RSP material containing coarse aggregate may be used. Addition of water and mixing shall be in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nWash water shall not be used as a portion of the mixing water for any joint repair 440\nconcrete.   LMC-VE shall be mixed in a mobile type volumetric mixer meeting the\nrequirements of 722.09(a). The Engineer may also allow batching and mixing of\nOPCC or RHCC in a mobile type volumetric mixer, except the mixer shall carry 445\nsufficient quantities of unmixed ingredients to produce at least 2 cu yds and is not required to be self-propelled. Calibration of the mixer shall be in accordance with 722.13.   509.11 Weather Limitations 450\nJoint repair concrete that has been placed shall be protected from rain. Materials\ndescribed in the QCP for protection of the edges and surface of the repair area shall be readily available for use. Should any damage result, the Engineer will suspend operations until corrective action as described in the QCP is taken.  455\nJoint repair concrete shall not be placed when either the ambient temperature or existing concrete pavement temperature is less than 50\u00b0F.   Temperature restrictions for chemical anchor systems used in anchoring deformed steel reinforcement for bottom half repairs shall be in accordance with the 460\nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\n509.12 Placing and Finishing Concrete\nAll CPM, OPCC, and RSP repair concrete mixes shall be placed within 15 minutes of mixing. RHCC and LMC-VE shall be placed within five minutes of mixing. 465\nAll repair concrete shall be placed such that a cold joint does not occur within the limits of any type of joint repair. Placement may be isolated to one side of a joint if the joint face or joint filler is properly supported. Repair along a transverse joint that intersects a previously repaired longitudinal joint is allowed as described in 509.08.  470\nFor CPM and OPCC mixes, the cleaned surface shall be lightly sprayed with water to wet the surface without ponding and a bonding grout shall be applied to the prepared surface. The grout shall consist of two parts Type I or Type II portland cement and\none part sand mixed with sufficient water to form a slurry that can be spread evenly\nonto the prepared concrete surface. The grout shall be mixed mechanically and applied 475\nby brushing or scrubbing, with a stiff bristle broom, onto the prepared and wetted concrete surface. The pot life of the grout shall not extend beyond 1 h. CPM or OPCC repair material shall be placed immediately after applying the bonding grout.   509.12\n487  For RHCC and LMC-VE mixes, thoroughly soak the cleaned surface and 480\nmaintain it in a wet condition for at least 2 h immediately prior to placing the repair concrete. Maintaining a wet surface shall be accomplished by covering the soaked surface with wet burlap. The burlap shall be re-wetted as necessary. A layer of white opaque polyethylene film, that is at least 4 mils thick, may be used to offset the need\nto rewet the burlap. Prior to placing the joint repair material, the burlap shall be 485\nremoved. Any standing water in depressions, holes, or areas of concrete removal shall be blown out with compressed air or other type of blower sufficient for removal, or by using an approved vacuum system. The surface shall be damp at time of placing the repair concrete. Bonding grout shall not be used.  490\nFor RSP mixes, the cleaned surface shall be lightly sprayed with water to thoroughly wet the surface without ponding. RSP repair material shall be placed immediately after wetting the surface. Bonding grout shall not be used.   When using a bonding grout, if the material dries or whitens prior to placing the 495\nconcrete joint repair material, the repair material shall not be placed. The dried grout\nshall be thoroughly removed by sandblasting and cleaning as specified in 509.09.\nConcrete for partial depth joint repair shall be placed monolithically with concrete for bottom-half joint repair, using the same concrete mixture. Concrete shall be 500\nconsolidated by internal vibration and struck off level to the adjacent PCCP. Joint filler shall remain straight for the length of the repair, within a tolerance of \u00b11/4 in. Concrete shall be hand finished and shall be controlled so that excess mortar and water is not worked into the surface. Final hand finishing shall have the trowels or floats work the surface from the joint toward the edge of the patch to avoid tearing the new concrete 505\naway from the existing pavement.\nEdging is required for fresh concrete adjacent to all joint filler or forms. Concrete\nrepairs at transverse joints shall not protrude into an HMA shoulder by more than 3/8 in. by forming or sawing the edges. The concrete surface of the partial depth joint 510\nrepair shall be textured by brooming in the longitudinal direction of the repair. All repairs shall be broom textured regardless of subsequent surface treatments.    The final finished surface of the repair shall not vary more than 1/8 in. from the existing pavement surface as measured with a straightedge over the joint. Partial depth 515\npatches that are not smooth shall be corrected by diamond grinding. Such grinding shall be completed after the concrete has gained sufficient strength for opening to traffic.\nImmediately upon completion of finishing and texturing of the partial depth joint 520\nrepair for all mixture types including CPM, OPCC, RHCC, LMC-VE, and RSP, grout shall be applied with a brush to the entire perimeter of the repair. Proportioning and mixing of the grout shall be the same as previously described in this section for bonding of CPM and OPCC mixes.  525 509.12\n488  509.13 Curing\nA resin-based liquid membrane forming compound in accordance with 912.01(e)2 shall be applied as soon as possible after the bleed water has dissipated. The compound shall be agitated in the shipping container to obtain a homogenous mixture for transfer to the job site application equipment. Application of curing compound shall be in 530\naccordance with the following:\n(a) Rate of application shall be at least 1 gal. per 200 sq ft of surface\ncuring area.\n535\n(b) Curing compound shall be applied to provide a uniform, solid,\nwhite opaque coverage on all exposed concrete surfaces similar to a white sheet of paper.\n(c) If the applied curing compound is damaged by rain or other 540\nmeans during the curing period, the damaged area shall be repaired as soon as possible by re-application at a rate equal to the original coat.\n\n(d) If the Engineer determines that the initial, or corrective re- 545\napplication, results in unsatisfactory curing, the Engineer may prohibit the use of curing compound and instead require the use of wet double burlap or waterproof covers in accordance with 504.04.\n550\nWhenever weather conditions exist that cause unusual or adverse placing and finishing conditions or equipment failures occur, the application of curing materials shall be expedited, or the mixing and placing operations shall be temporarily suspended as the conditions require.  555\nWhen a deficiency is identified in the curing process, the joint repair shall be\nremoved and replaced.

If they are stored outside, the roots shall first be puddled in a paste solution of backfill and water. 35\nThe plants shall then be separated and their root systems heeled-in by completely\ncovering with moist soil. If they are stored inside, the roots shall be puddled in a paste solution of backfill and water. Straw, peat moss, or corncobs shall be worked in and around the root system and kept moist.   40\nPlants which are delivered in boxes, wrapped bundles, or other forms of closed 622.01\n582 containers, including trucks, and which are stored inside may remain in the container\nfor 48 h from time of delivery, provided the containers are opened immediately and the plants are watered if necessary.  45\nIf the outside temperature is 35\u00b0F or less when plants are delivered, the plants\nshall be placed in inside storage immediately. Inside storage procedures shall be in\naccordance with the above requirements. Plants may be transferred to outside storage when the outside temperature exceeds 35\u00b0F provided they are puddled again and then heeled-in. 50\nTemperature inside the storage building shall be maintained between 35\u00b0F and 55\u00b0F. Plants shall not remain in storage, either inside or outside, for more than seven\ndays, unless otherwise specified because of unfavorable planting conditions.  55\nPlants may be rejected on failure to comply with these specifications.    (b) Balled and Burlapped Plants and Container Grown Plants\nPlants shall be planted or placed in storage before being exposed for\n10 consecutive hours at temperatures less than 35\u00b0F. Storage of plants shall be in a 60\nmoist storage building or they shall be placed outside in a compact group with balls or containers completely covered with corncobs and kept moist. Plants shall not remain in storage for more than 10 days, unless otherwise specified due to unfavorable planting conditions.  65\nPlants may be rejected upon failure to comply with these specifications.   622.04 Collected Plants  At least 24 h before starting to dig collected plants, notification shall be given of\nthe time and place of digging so inspection of the work and of the plants can be made, 70\nas desired.   Collected plants shall be dug carefully in a satisfactory manner. All operations of digging, transporting, and replanting collected plants shall be in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations of the State. 75\n622.05 Excavation for Plant Holes  Stakes will be set to locate plant holes for each tree, shrub, or vine. The outline of each seeding bed will be staked and the planting on the required centers shall be as directed. Stakes for the staking operation shall be furnished. The location stakes shall 80\nbe removed as directed. Excavation shall be such that the plant holes are cylindrical in\nshape with the sides approximately vertical. Material excavated from the holes may\nbe used for backfill providing it is in accordance with 914.01. Otherwise, it shall be distributed uniformly within the construction area as directed. The excavated material shall not be stockpiled on turf or in ditches. Material unsuitable for the growth of 85\nvegetation, including rocks and boulders, shall be disposed of outside the right-of-way\nas directed and in accordance with 203.01 and 203.10. Plant holes shall be in 622.05\n583 accordance with the details and tables shown on the plans. If plants have not been\nplanted within 10 days after excavation of the hole, the hole shall be refilled and re-\nexcavated at the time of planting. No additional payment will be made for this 90\noperation.\nIf, after staking or excavation of the plant holes at the locations shown on the\nplans, it becomes apparent that the location is unsuitable for planting due to accumulation of groundwater, possible flooding because of terrain conditions, or 95\nunsuitable soil conditions, plant holes shall be relocated as directed. Such relocation shall be done with no additional payment.   622.06 Planting Season  The planting season shall be from September 1 through the following May 25, 100\nwith the exception that trees shall be planted from October 1 through the following\nApril 15, provided that trees are dormant. Bare rooted plants shall be planted only when the outside air temperature exceeds 35\u00b0F. Unless otherwise approved, deciduous plants, except those container grown, shall be dormant at the time they arrive at the\nwork or storage site. Evergreens shall not have active terminal growth. At least 40% 105\nof the total number of balled and burlapped, and container grown plants shall be\nplanted from the beginning of the planting season through December 31. Bare root seedlings for wildlife habitat shall be planted from October 1 through the following April 30. Container grown seedlings for wildlife habitat shall be planted at any time.  110\nThe initial planting and spring replacements, in accordance with 622.18, shall be completed satisfactorily within the planting season which expires prior to the completion date of the contract. The establishment period for these plants shall be from the end of the specified planting period to the fall inspection. If the initial planting and spring replacements are not completed within the specified time, the completion date 115\nmay be extended one year to provide an establishment period. If the completion date\nis extended, all requirements of 622.18 shall apply until final inspection and acceptance.   622.07 Pruning 120\nBefore the plant is placed in the plant hole, any bruised or broken parts of roots shall be cut off smoothly as approved unless otherwise specified or directed. All plants shall be pruned either before or after planting. Such pruning generally shall consist of thinning out or cutting back secondary branching to reduce the foliage by 1/3 to 1/2 in accordance with accepted horticultural practices. Pruning operations shall maintain the 125\ngeneral crown outline and characteristic branching pattern for each species. Pruning or cutting back of terminal leaders which are over 3/8 in. in diameter at the point of\ncut will not be allowed. Broken or dead branches, or any other objectionable parts of\nthe plant, shall be removed throughout the life of the contract. Pruning tools shall be kept sharp and shall be sterilized in denatured alcohol after each hour of use. All cut 130\nsurfaces 3/8 in. or more in diameter shall be painted with a tree wound dressing.   Bare rooted shrubs shall be cut back to 1/2 their minimum specified height as 622.06\n584 shown on the plans. Pruning shall be performed after the shrubs have been sealed with\nDepartment seals and prior to the leaf buds breaking dormancy. At the time of the 135\nspring and fall inspections, bare rooted shrubs will be accepted at their original specified height provided they are healthy, in good growing condition, and are no less than 1/2 the minimum specified height.\n\n622.08 Planting, Backfilling, and Watering 140\nThe plant shall be placed in the plant hole at the proper position for depth, alignment, final grade of the surrounding ground level, and vertical position of the trunk. The planting procedure shall be performed in such a manner that the top of the ball of the plant is as shown on the plans at the time of planting. The planting procedure shall be in accordance with the details as shown on the plans. Backfill material in 145\naccordance with 914.01 shall be placed around all plants except seedlings. The quantities of backfill material required per plant shall be as shown on the plans.   In areas which are designated on the plans as beds for group planting, the soil shall be tilled to a minimum depth of 6 in. in such a manner that all sod and vegetation 150\nis destroyed. These areas shall be tilled at least two times with an interval of 14 days\nbetween tilling operations. Planting may be done immediately after the second tilling. Additional tilling shall be performed if vegetation appears before mulch is applied. Sod and vegetation shall be removed in lieu of the tilling operation when the soil temperature or moisture conditions are such that the sod and vegetation would not be 155\ndestroyed by tilling. At other times, sod and vegetation may be removed in lieu of tilling. If the excavation resulting from sod removal is greater than 1 in. deep, it shall be backfilled with topsoil to 1 in. above the original ground.   After sod and vegetation removal and backfilling, the bed area shall be cultivated 160\nto a depth of 6 in. Large clods, rocks, and other debris encountered in the cultivation\nwork and any excess soil shall be removed. The outline of beds for group plantings\nshall be no closer than 3 ft to the center of any of the outer plants in the area.   In addition to the water applied at the time of planting, unless excessive moisture 165\nprevails, a minimum of two supplemental waterings shall be applied between May 1\nand June 15, and one every 14 days between June 15 and September 15. Sufficient water shall be applied to individual plants to saturate the backfill and the mulch area. Plants in beds shall receive water equivalent to the quantity used for individual plants. Liquid fertilizer in accordance with 622.09, may be applied with the supplemental 170\nwatering and the method of application is subject to approval. Lance watering will not be allowed.\nContainer grown seedlings for wildlife habitat which have been planted from\nJune 1 through August 31 shall be maintained after installation for 30 days. 175\nMaintenance shall include watering the seedlings at the time of planting and once every seven days.  622.08\n585   (a) Plants with Bare Roots\nWith the plant in its proper position, the plant hole shall be backfilled with 180\nmaterial in accordance with 914.01. The backfill material shall be worked firmly around the roots as the hole is gradually filled. The plant shall be raised gently and lowered slightly as the soil is added to help eliminate air pockets around the roots. Soil\nshall be added in layers of about 6 in. and each layer tamped to make it firm and to\nhold the plant perpendicular. Water shall be used to settle the soil and to eliminate air 185\npockets around the roots, unless otherwise directed. The top 4 in. of soil necessary to fill the plant hole completely shall be a very fine mixture and shall be placed on top of the firmed backfill and allowed to remain loose and untamped.    (b) Balled and Burlapped Plants 190\nBalled and burlapped plants shall be handled by the ball and placed in the holes in such a manner that the soil of the ball does not become loosened from the roots. The soil directly beneath the ball shall be firmed to minimize settling. Guy stakes shall be driven before backfilling operations begin. After the hole has been partially backfilled and the material firmed under and around the ball, the burlap shall be cut away and 195\nremoved from the stem of the plant. Backfilling and firming shall then be completed\nin a manner to avoid loosening the soil from the root ball. Watering shall be done in accordance with 622.08(a). Backfill material shall be in accordance with 914.01.    (c) Seedlings for Wildlife Habitat 200\nSeedlings shall be from 6 to 18 in. in height. Seedlings shall be planted as directed in the locations shown on the plans. Species shall be selected from the list as shown on the plans. Alternate species selection shall be subject to approval. Seedlings shall be planted no closer to each other than the distance shown on the plans. Seedlings shall not be planted in rows, but instead shall be planted in a natural appearing pattern. 205\nFailure to comply with this procedure will require the replanting of the seedlings as\ndirected with no additional payment. All damaged seedlings shall be replaced with no\nadditional payment if replanting is required.   622.09 Liquid Fertilizer Application 210\nAll plants shall be fertilized with a water soluble 5-10-10 fertilizer, or an\nequivalent amount of plant nutrients, at the rate of 0.75 lb/100 gal. of water. Fertilizer shall be applied to each installed plant until the mulched area over the plant hole is saturated. Three applications shall be made: one on or about July 1; one about August\n1; and one about September 1. 215\n622.10 Mulching\nMulch, in accordance with 914.05(b), shall be placed as a top layer around each\nplant as soon as it has been installed. The mulch shall cover the entire area as described\nin 622.08 and shall be placed around individual plants in accordance with the plans. 220\n622.11 Guying and Staking  Guying and staking shall be in accordance with the details shown on the plans.

Three wood stakes shall be spaced 225\nequally about each tree. The guy wire shall be secured to each stake at an approximately right angle. Support of multi-stem trees of 4 to 6 ft in height shall consist of inner limb guying and bracing stakes. The securement point and placement of guy wire shall avoid abrasion of tree limbs. The guys and stakes shall be maintained\nfor the duration of the contract. Prior to final inspection, all materials used to support 230\ntrees shall be removed and disposed of, except as otherwise directed for trees requiring additional bracing time. However, supports for fall replacement shall remain in place. If approved, stakes may be left flush with the ground.   622.12 Plant Protection 235\n(a) Borer Control Coatings\nWithin five days after planting and prior to wrapping, all trees, except evergreens, shall be protected against borer attack with an insecticide mixture applied to the tree trunk with a paint brush or a suitable hand sprayer. The application shall cover the 240\ntrunk from the root crown to the first major branches. The mixture shall consist of\nenough powdered skim milk to form a smooth slurry when added to either dieldrin 18\nat the rate of 2 qt to 50 gal. of water or thiodan 50 at the rate of 1 lb to 50 gal. of water.

This work shall also consist of providing test piles and performing loading tests when required. Piling shall be installed at the location and to the tip elevation, the penetration depth, and nominal driving resistance shown on the plans in accordance with 105.03.  10\nMATERIALS\n701.02 Materials\nMaterials shall be in accordance with the following:\n15\nB Borrow ............................................................ 904.06*\nBentonite Grout ................................................... 913.06\nConcrete Piles ..................................................... 707   Conical Pile Tips ................................................. 915.01(a)2\nEnd Plates ........................................................... 915.01(a)1 20\nEpoxy Coating for Piles ....................................... 915.01(d)\nPile Shoes............................................................ 915.03\nReinforcing Bars ................................................. 910.01\nSteel H Piles ........................................................ 915.02\nSteel Pipe Piles .................................................... 915.01 25\nStructural Concrete .............................................. 702\nTimber Pilin g, Trea ted ......................................... 911.02(c)\nTimber Piling,  Untrea ted ..................................... 911.01(e)\n\n* B borrow consisting of ACBF or GBF shall not be used.\n30\nUnless otherwise specified, reinforcing bars may be either plain or epoxy coated.   Steel pipe piles shall consist of a steel pipe which is driven into place and filled\nwith Class A concrete.  35\nThe Contractor may furnish and drive steel pipe piles with thicker walls than specified.   Treated and untreated timber piles shall be strapped with at least three straps: one\napproximately 18 in. from the butt, one approximately 24 in. from the butt, and one 40\napproximately 12 in. from the tip. Additional straps shall be provided at approximately 15 ft centers between the butt and tip. Strapping shall encircle the pile once and be tensioned as tightly as possible. Straps shall be 1 1/4 in. wide, 0.031 in. thick, cold rolled, fully heat treated, high tensile strapping, painted and waxed, with breaking 701.01\n604 strength of 5,500 lb. The strap shall be crimped with a notch type sealer to furnish a 45\njoint yielding 80% of the strap tensile strength. Treated timber piles shall be strapped after treatment.   701.03 Handling of Epoxy Coated Piles\nEpoxy coated piles shall be protected at all times from damage to the epoxy 50\ncoating. Damage to epoxy coated piles shall be repaired in accordance with 915.01(d). Epoxy coated piles will be rejected if the total area of repair to the coating exceeds 2% of the total coated surface area.\nCONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS 55\n701.04 Equipment for Driving Piles    (a) Approval of Pile Driving Equipment  All pile driving equipment, including the pile driving hammer, hammer cushion, 60\nhelmet or pile drive head, pile cushion, and other appurtenances furnished by the\nContractor shall be in working condition and approved in writing by the Engineer prior\nto delivery of the pile driving equipment to the job site. All pile driving equipment shall be sized such that the piles can be driven to the length required without damage. Approval of pile driving equipment does not relieve the Contractor of the 65\nresponsibility to drive piles, free of damage, to the required nominal driving resistance and, if specified, the minimum tip elevation shown on the plans. Pile driving equipment will be subject to satisfactory performance during production.   The Contractor shall submit a completed pile and driving equipment data form to 70\nthe Engineer at least 15 calendar days prior to driving piles. The pile and driving equipment data form is available on the Department\u2019s website. The Contractor will be\nnotified of the acceptance of the proposed pile driving system within 15 calendar days\nof the receipt of the pile and driving equipment data form. Acceptance of pile and driving equipment does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to provide 75\nequipment suitable for driving the specified piling to the required bearing without damage.   If the method of pile driving approval is in accordance with the dynamic formula shown in 701.05(a) the dynamic formula method will be used to determine if the pile 80\ndriving equipment is acceptable for use. To be considered for approval, the proposed driving system shall obtain the nominal driving resistance between the specified blow count range of 30 and 120 blows per foot.\nIf the nominal driving resistance is to be determined by dynamic pile load test in 85\naccordance with 701.05(b) or static load test in accordance with 701.05(c), the Engineer will use the wave equation analysis method for driving system approval. To be approved, the proposed driving system shall obtain the nominal driving resistance\nbetween the specified blow count range of 30 and 120 blows per foot and shall maintain driving stresses below the specified driving stress limits for the pile type 90 701.04\n605 being driven. If wave equation predicted driving stresses are greater than specification\nlimits or the wave equation blow count for the nominal driving resistance is outside the specified blow count range, the Contractor shall modify or replace the proposed equipment until subsequent wave equation analyses indicate the piles can be driven to the nominal driving resistance within the allowable blow count range and within 95\ndriving stress limits.\nIf the driving system requires revision, the Contractor will be notified of the acceptance of the revised driving system within seven calendar days of receipt of a revised pile and driving equipment data form. 100\nThe Contractor shall use the approved pile driving system. No changes shall be made without prior written approval from the Engineer, with the exception that the concrete pile cushion thickness may be increased to control driving stresses. A change in the pile driving system will only be considered after the Contractor has submitted a 105\nnew pile and driving equipment data form. The Contractor will be notified of the\nacceptance of a proposed change in driving equipment within three business days of\nreceipt of the pile and driving equipment data form. If the Engineer determines the\nContractor\u2019s hammer is not functioning properly and is unable to drive the piles to the required penetration depth or nominal driving resistance, the hammer shall be removed 110\nfrom service.     1. Dynamic Formula Method\nIf the dynamic formula method is used, the energy of the pile driving equipment shall be rated by the manufacturer at or above the appropriate minimum 115\nmanufacturer\u2019s rated hammer energy for the corresponding nominal driving resistance as shown in the table below. The table below will be used as the basis of approval of pile driving equipment for the dynamic formula method.\n\nDYNAMIC FORMULA METHOD\nMinimum Pile Hammer Requirements\nNominal Driving\nResistance Minimum Manufacturer\u2019s\nRated Ener gy\nkips ft\u00b7lb\n\u0094\u0003\u0014\u001b\u0013  12,000\n181 - 300 21,000\n301 - 400 28,800\n> 400 Wave Equation Analysis\nrequired\n120\nThe minimum rated energies do not account for losses and inefficiencies in the pile driving system. If the hammer selected cannot satisfy all the criteria, a wave\nequation analysis shall be submitted by the Contractor for approval.\n701.04\n606    2. Wave Equation Analysis Method 125\nFor the pile driving equipment to be acceptable, the driving stresses predicted by the wave equation analysis shall not exceed the values where pile damage impends. These limiting values shall be calculated as follows:\na. The maximum compressive and tensile driving stresses 130\nfor steel piles = 0.9F\ny.\nb. The maximum compressive driving stress for\nprestressed concrete piles = (0.85f\u2019\nc - f pe), where f pe is\nthe effective prestress value. 135\nc. The maximum tensile driving stress, psi, for prestressed\nconcrete piles = \u0da7f\nc' + fpe3, where f\u2019 c and f pe are\nexpressed in psi.\n140\nd. The effective prestress, f pe, shall be obtained from the\napproved working drawings.\ne. The maximum driving stress, psi for timber piles shall\nnot exceed 3F\nco, where F co is the base resistance of 145\nwood in compression parallel to the grain, in psi.\n(b) Pile Hammers\nPiles may be driven with air, steam, diesel, or hydraulic hammers. Gravity hammers, vibratory hammers, and other pile driving methods shall be used only if 150\nspecified or approved in writing by the Engineer.\n1. Gravity Hammers  Gravity or drop hammers shall be used to drive timber piles only. The ram shall have a weight of between 2,000 and 3,500 lb. The height of drop shall not exceed 12 ft. 155\nThe weight of gravity hammers shall not be less than the combined weight of the helmet and pile. All gravity hammers shall be equipped with hammer guides and helmet to ensure concentric impact on the drive head.     2. Single or Double Acting Steam and Air Hammers 160\nThe plant and equipment furnished for steam and air hammers shall have sufficient capacity to maintain, under working conditions, the volume and pressure\nspecified by the manufacturer of the hammer. The hose connecting the air compressor\nto the hammer shall be at least the minimum size recommended by the manufacturer. The plant and equipment shall be equipped with accurate chamber pressure gauges 165\nwhich are easily accessible to the Engineer. If wave equation analysis is not used for pre-approval, the weight of the striking parts of air and steam hammers shall be equal to or greater than one-third the combined weights of the drive head and pile being 701.04\n607 driven. The striking parts shall not weigh less than 2,800 lb. Proximity switches and\nan electronic readout device shall be provided prior to driving piling. 170\n3. Diesel Hammers  Open-end or single acting diesel hammers shall be equipped with a device such\nas graduated rings or grooves on the ram to enable the Engineer to visually determine\nhammer stroke at all times during pile driving operations. The Contractor shall provide 175\nthe Engineer a chart from the hammer manufacturer equating stroke, blows per minute, and potential energy for the approved open-end diesel hammer. The Contractor shall also provide and maintain, in working order, an approved device that automatically measures and displays the ram stroke for open-end diesel hammers.  180\nClosed-end double acting diesel hammers shall be equipped with an accurate bounce chamber pressure gauge, easily accessible to the Engineer. The Contractor shall provide the Engineer a calibrated chart equating bounce chamber pressure to either equivalent energy or stroke for the closed-end diesel hammer to be used. Calibration of actual hammer performance shall be performed no more than 90 days 185\nprior to the beginning of the work.\n4. Hydraulic Hammers  Under working conditions, the power plant shall have sufficient capacity to\nmaintain the volume and pressure for the hydraulic hammer as specified by the 190\nmanufacturer. Hydraulic hammers shall also be equipped with a controlled variable stroke system and a readout device to measure ram energy. The plant and equipment shall be equipped with accurate pressure and velocity gauges and an energy readout device which are easily accessible to the Engineer.\n195\n5. Vibratory Hammers\nExcept for pile lengths which have been evaluated from load test piles, the\nnominal driving resistance of the piles driven with vibratory hammers shall be verified by redriving the first pile driven in each group of 10 or fewer piles with an impact hammer of suitable energy to measure the nominal driving resistance before driving 200\nthe remaining piles in the group. All piles which rely on point bearing capacity shall be redriven with an impact hammer.    (c) Pile Driving Aids\nPile driving aids such as jets and followers, shall not be used unless specified or 205\napproved in writing by the Engineer. If specified or approved, pile driving aids shall be used for installing production piles only after the minimum pile tip elevation is established by means of load testing or indicator test piles conventionally driven in\naccordance with 701.05. The Contractor shall perform all extra load tests or extra work\nrequired to drive indicator test piles as determined by the Engineer. 210\n1. Hammer Cushion  All impact pile driving equipment, except gravity hammers, shall be equipped with a suitable thickness of hammer cushion material to prevent damage to the hammer 701.04\n608 or pile and to ensure uniform driving behavior. Impact hammers designed such that a 215\nhammer cushion is not required are excluded from this requirement. Hammer cushions shall be made of durable, manufactured materials, provided in accordance with the hammer manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Wood, wire rope, or asbestos hammer cushions shall not be used. A striker plate, as recommended by the hammer manufacturer, shall\nbe placed on the hammer cushion to ensure uniform compression of the cushion 220\nmaterial. The condition of the hammer cushion shall be checked with the Engineer when beginning pile driving at each structure or after each 100 h of pile driving, whichever is less. A hammer cushion whose thickness has been reduced to less than 75% of the original thickness shall be replaced.  225\n2. Helmet  Piles driven with impact hammers shall have an adequate helmet that adequately distributes the hammer blow uniformly and concentrically to the pile head. The helmet shall be axially aligned with the hammer and the pile shall be guided by the leads and not be free-swinging. The helmet shall fit around the pile head and prevent transfer of 230\ntorsional forces during driving while maintaining proper alignment of hammer and\npile.\nFor steel and timber piling, the pile heads shall be cut squarely. For timber piles, the least inside helmet horizontal dimension or hammer base horizontal dimension 235\nshall not exceed the pile head diameter by more than 2 in. If the timber pile diameter slightly exceeds the least helmet or hammer base dimension, the pile head shall be trimmed to fit the helmet.   A helmet as recommended by the manufacturer shall be provided to hold the axis 240\nof the pile in line with the axis of the hammer. The pile head shall be plane and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pile to prevent eccentric impacts from the\ndrive head.\n3. Pile Cushion 245\nThe heads of concrete piles shall each be protected with a pile cushion made of plywood, hardwood, or composite plywood and hardwood materials. The use of manufactured pile cushion materials shall be by the hammer manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. The pile cushion dimensions shall equal or exceed the cross-sectional area of the pile top, and shall be sized to fit the dimensions of the pile 250\ncap. The minimum pile cushion thickness placed on the pile head prior to driving shall be either as recommended by wave equation analysis or not less than 4 in. if the dynamic formula is used. A new pile cushion shall be provided for each pile. The pile cushion shall be replaced if, during the driving of the pile, the cushion is either\ncompressed more than one-half the original thickness or begins to smolder or burn. 255\nPile cushions shall be protected from weather and kept dry prior to use. Pile cushions shall not be soaked in liquid unless approved by the Engineer.   A used pile cushion in acceptable condition shall be used for restrike tests. The used pile cushion shall be the same pile cushion from the end of initial driving on that 260 701.04\n609 pile unless the condition of that pile cushion is no longer within specification limits.\nIf the original pile cushion is not within specification limits, a used cushion of similar thickness as the end of drive pile cushion shall be used.     4. Leads 265\nPiles shall be supported in line and position with leads while being driven. Pile\ndriver leads shall be constructed in a manner that affords freedom of movement of the hammer while maintaining alignment of the hammer and the pile to ensure concentric impact for each blow. Leads may be either fixed or swinging type. Swinging leads, when used, shall be fitted with a pile gate at the bottom of the leads. The leads shall 270\nbe adequately embedded in the ground, or the pile shall be constrained in a structural frame such as a template to maintain alignment. The leads shall be of sufficient length to make the use of a follower unnecessary and shall be designed as to enable proper\nalignment of battered piles.  275\n5. Followers  Followers shall only be used if specified or approved in writing by the Engineer.\nIf a follower is allowed, the first pile in each bent and every tenth pile driven thereafter\nshall be driven full length without a follower, to verify that adequate pile length is being attained to develop the nominal driving resistance. The follower and pile shall 280\nbe held and maintained in equal and proper alignment during driving. The follower shall be of such material and dimensions to enable the piles to be driven to the required penetration depth determined necessary from the driving of the full length piles.   The final position and alignment of the first two piles installed with followers in 285\neach substructure unit shall not exceed more than 3 in. from the locations shown on the plans before additional piles are installed.\n6. Jets\nJetting shall only be allowed if specified or approved in writing by the Engineer. 290\nThe Contractor shall determine the number of jets and the volume and pressure of water at the jet nozzles necessary to freely erode the material adjacent to the pile without affecting the lateral stability of the final in-place pile. The Contractor shall be responsible for all damage to the site caused by unapproved or improper jetting operations. If jetting is specified, the jetting plant shall have sufficient capacity to 295\nenable installation to the required elevation, location, and alignment in accordance with 701.09(b). Unless otherwise directed, external jet pipes shall be removed once the pile tip is 5 ft above the prescribed tip elevation, depending on soil conditions. The pile shall then be driven to the nominal driving resistance with an impact hammer. The Contractor shall provide suitable sediment control measures for jet water in 300\naccordance with the specifications. Where practical, all piles in a pile group shall be\njetted to the required penetration depth before beginning pile driving. Where large pile groups or pile spacing and batter make this impractical, restrike tests on a select number of previously driven piles shall be performed to check nominal driving resistance after jetting operations are completed. 305\n701.04\n610  Upon completion of driving a jetted pile, all voids around the pile shall be filled\nwith B borrow and saturated with water.     7. Collars 310\nWhere timber piles are used, collars, bands, or other devices shall be provided to\nprotect piles against splitting and brooming.\n8. Pile Shoes, End Plates, and Conical Pile Tips  Pile shoes shall be used when specified. End plates or conical pile tips shall be 315\nused on pipe piles. Steel pile shoes shall be used on H piles if specified.   If shoes are required on timber piles, the tips of timber piles shall conform to the approved steel shoes to ensure a firm uniform contact and prevent local stresses concentrations in the timber. 320\n701.05 Nominal Driving Resistance of a Driven Pile  The Engineer will use one of the following methods as specified to determine the\nnominal driving resistance of a driven pile.\n325\n(a) Dynamic Formula\nThe nominal driving resistance will be determined by means of a dynamic formula. Piles shall be driven to the penetration depth necessary to obtain the nominal driving resistance. The nominal driving resistance, as shown on the plans, can be calculated from the formula as follows: 330\n\nR\nndr = 1.75\u03beE x (log 10N) \u2013 100\nwhere:\nR\nndr = nominal drivin g resistance in kips\nE = manufacturer\u2019s rated energy in foot\u00b7pounds at the field observed\nram stroke and not reduced for efficienc y\nlog 10N = logarithm to the base 10 of the quantity 10 multiplied by N,\nwhere N is the number of hammer blows per 1 in. at final penetration.\n335\nAn indicator test pile shall be the first pile driven at each bent and pier and shall\nbe driven to the plan tip elevation or to the nominal driving resistance whichever\noccurs first. All indicator test piles shall be driven with impact hammers unless\notherwise directed. The length of indicator test piles shall be greater than the estimated length of production piles to provide for variation in soil conditions. Precast concrete 340\nand treated timber test piles shall be a minimum of 10 ft longer than the estimated length of piling shown on the plans. Steel piles shall be provided such that additional 10 ft of driving will not require an additional splice.   The driving equipment used for driving indicator test piles shall be identical to 345\nthat proposed for use on the production piling and shall be subject to approval. The 701.05\n611 Contractor shall excavate the ground at each indicator test pile location to the elevation\nof the bottom of the footing before the pile is driven, unless otherwise shown on the plans.  350\nTo assess the effects of relaxation and setup, each indicator test pile shall be\nrestruck after the number of hours specified unless otherwise approved. The hammer\nshall be warmed up before driving begins by applying at least 20 blows to another fixed object. The maximum amount of penetration required during restrike shall be 3 in., or the total number of hammer blows shall be 20, whichever occurs first. If the 355\nindicator test pile does attain the nominal driving resistance upon restriking, the penetration resistance attained during initial driving shall be used to establish the adequacy of production piles. If the nominal driving resistance is not attained upon restriking, the Contractor shall redrive the indicator test pile until it achieves the nominal driving resistance and repeat the restrike procedure described above. If the 360\nnominal driving resistance is still not obtained, pile driving shall stop immediately,\nand the Office of Geotechnical Services shall be notified.\nA record of driving indicator test piles, which includes the number of hammer\nblows per 1 ft for the entire driven length, the as-driven length, cutoff elevation, 365\npenetration, and all other pertinent information will be kept by the Engineer. The penetration resistance at various hammer strokes versus nominal driving resistance relationship will be determined based on the driving of representative indicator test piles.  370\nIf indicator piles are not shown on the plans, all piles shall be driven to the nominal driving resistance and restriking is not required.    (b) Dynamic Pile Load Test\nDynamic monitoring will be performed for the purpose of obtaining the nominal 375\ndriving resistance, pile driving stresses, pile integrity, and pile driving system performance. Dynamic monitoring will be conducted by PDA in accordance with ASTM D4945. PDA will be performed on the fi rst pile driven. The length of the pile\nused in the dynamic pile load test shall be a minimum of 10 ft greater than the\nestimated length of production piles to provide for variation in soil conditions. The 380\nContractor shall assist the Department in obtaining dynamic measurements with the PDA during initial pile driving and during pile restrikes. If a static load test is required, the dynamic pile load test shall be performed on the same pile as the pile used in the static load test. The restrike for the dynamic pile load test on a static load test pile shall be performed within 48 h of completion of the static load test. 385\n\n1. Scheduling\nThe Contractor shall notify the Engineer at least seven calendar days before the\nscheduled date of driving piles to be monitored by PDA. The Contractor shall confirm the driving date three calendar days prior to the scheduled driving date. The Contractor 390\nshall indicate at which foundation production pile driving is to begin. The Engineer will provide final driving criteria for the indicated foundation first. 701.05\n612\n2. Dynamic Monitoring  The Contractor shall make the steel piles available so that the Engineer can 395\npredrill the required instrument attachment holes prior to the Contractor placing the pile in the leads. Each pile to be tested shall be instrumented with force and\nacceleration transducers provided by the Department. The Contractor shall install the\ntransducers before striking the pile. The pile driving may have to be temporarily interrupted for the transducers to be adjusted or replaced, or for the monitoring results 400\nassessed.   Prior to placement in the leads, the Contractor shall make each designated concrete or timber pile available for taking of wave speed measurements and for predrilling the required instrument attachment holes. When wave speed measurements 405\nare made, the piling shall be in a horizontal position and not in contact with other piling. Predriving wave speed measurements will not be required for steel piles. The Contractor shall mount the instruments near the head of the pile after the pile is placed in the leads.\n410\nThe Contractor shall drive the test pile to the minimum tip elevation and to the penetration depth at which the dynamic test equipment indicates that the nominal driving resistance shown on the plans and in accordance with 701.04(a) has been achieved. The Contractor may reduce the driving energy transmitted to the pile by using additional cushions or reducing the energy output of the hammer in order to 415\nmaintain stresses below the values shown in 701.04(a)1. If non-axial driving is indicated by the dynamic test equipment measurements, the Contractor shall immediately realign the hammer system. Upon determination by the Engineer that valid data has been secured, the Contractor shall assist the Engineer with the removal of the instrumentation from the pile. 420\n\n3. Restrike  The Contractor shall wait the specified minimum time period prior to the\nrestriking of a dynamic load test pile. The Contractor shall assist the Engineer with reattachment of dynamic test instruments. The hammer shall be warmed up before 425\nrestriking begins by applying at least 20 blows to another pile or other fixed object. The maximum amount of penetration required during restrike will be 3 in., or the total number of hammer blows will be 20, whichever occurs first. If the pile does not achieve the required nominal driving resistance during restrike, the Engineer will either accept the tip elevation or specify additional pile penetration and testing. 430\nOnce the restrike test for the test pile is complete, the Engineer will run CAPWAP\nanalyses and will provide the final driving criteria within two business days of the\nrestrike test. Production piles driven prior to receipt of the final driving criteria shall be done at the Contractor\u2019s risk. Final driving criteria for additional structures will be 435\nprovided within two business days of the restrike test or, when multiple test piles are restruck the same day, at a rate of one substructure location per business day in the\norder requested by the Contractor.\n701.05\n613    4. PDA on Local Public Agency Contract  440\nThe Contractor shall perform the PDA in accordance with ASTM D4945. The\nfirm conducting the PDA shall have at least one geotechnical engineer who shall have achieved one of the following certification levels: intermediate, advanced, master, or expert, within the last three years through the Dynamic Measurement and Analyses\nProficiency Test conducted by Pile Dynamics, Inc., and the Pile Driving Contractors 445\nAssociation. An engineer with a lower certification level can provide services so long as this individual is under the direct supervision of an engineer with intermediate certification level or higher. The CAPWAP shall be utilized to determine the as-built pile capacity from the PDA data. The first pile driven for each substructure unit shall be a PDA test pile. The pile driving criteria with the PDA and CAPWAP results shall 450\nbe submitted to the Department\u2019s Office of Geotechnical Services for approval.    (c) Static Load Test\nA static load test shall be conducted on a non-production test pile at the location\nshown on the plans. The test pile axial deflection in compression shall be verified by 455\nperforming actual loading tests of the designated static load test pile in accordance\nwith ASTM D1143, Quick Load Test Method, with loads applied by hydraulic jack.\nThe test shall be continued until either plunging failure is achieved or the capacity of the loading system is reached. The nominal pile resistance will be determined from the settlement versus load curve generated by the incremental loading in accordance with 460\n701.05(c)1.   The top elevation of all test piles shall be determined immediately after driving and again just before load testing to check for heave. A pile which heaves more than 1/4 in. shall be redriven, or jacked, to the original elevation prior to testing. The 465\nContractor shall wait 36 h between the driving of a load test pile and the commencement of the load testing unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe Contractor shall provide complete protection at all times for the pile, supports, and reference beam from wind, direct sunlight, frost action, or other 470\ndisturbances. The Contractor shall maintain an air temperature in the immediate vicinity of the test pile and reference beam of not less than 50\u00b0F and shall provide adequate lighting for the duration of the test.   No production piles shall be driven until completion of the static pile load test 475\nunless approved by the Engineer. Reaction piles shall be driven prior to driving the static load test pile.     1. Load Test Procedure\nThe Contractor shall furnish and construct a suitable reaction frame or load 480\nplatform to provide a load on the pile having a capacity of 2,000 kips or 150% of the nominal driving resistance, whichever is less. A minimum of seven days prior to driving the static load test pile or construction of the reaction frame or load platform, the Contractor shall submit, for review and approval, detailed working drawings to scale for the reaction frame or load platform and loading apparatus including the 485 701.05\n614 distances between the load test pile and all reaction piles and reference beam supports.\nThe submittal shall also include a proposed load test and reaction pile driving sequence, a scaled profile drawing of the loading apparatus detailing the ground surface elevation, the pile cutoff elevation, the dimensions and locations of all bearing plates, the jack, the load cell, the spherical bearing plate, and the reaction beam or 490\nplatform.\nWorking drawings for the reaction frame and loading apparatus shall be submitted in accordance with 105.02. The submittal shall include calibration certifications for the hydraulic jacks, load cell, pressure gauges, and hydraulic pumps conducted within 495\n30 days of the load test. If required by the Engineer, the jack, load cell, and pressure gauge shall be recalibrated after the load test. The loading apparatus shall be constructed to allow the various increments of the load to be placed gradually, without causing vibration to the test pile. If the approved method requires the use of tension or reaction piles, the reaction piles, if feasible, shall be of the same type and dimensions 500\nas the production piles and shall be driven in the location of permanent piles. Reaction piles that are the same type and dimensions as the production piles and are driven in\nthe location of permanent piles will be considered permanent piles.\nTimber or tapered piles installed in permanent locations shall not be used as 505\ntension piles. The primary method of determining the applied load shall be from a calibrated load cell. Incremental loads of 5% of the nominal driving resistance shall be placed on the pile at 5-minute intervals until continuous jacking is required to maintain the incremental load or the capacity of the load frame is reached. Support for the load test plates, jack, and ancillary devices shall be provided to prevent them from 510\nfalling in the event of a release of load due to hydraulic failure, test pile failure, or other cause.\nThe Contractor shall furnish the hydraulic pump, load cell, spherical bearing plate,\nand two reference beams. Each reference beam shall be a W or M section, of minimum 515\nlength of 20 ft, and a weight of 5 to 20 lb/ft unless otherwise approved. The Engineer will conduct the static load test and will provide the gauges to measure movement of the test pile. The Contractor shall provide all assistance necessary to perform the static load test. The Contractor shall furnish and install telltale rods encased in a lubricated pipe in the test pile prior to the static load test. 520\nIf the nominal pile resistance of a pile from the load settlement curve does not equal or exceed the nominal driving resistance shown on the plans, the Contractor shall redrive the pile to an adequate nominal driving resistance. The increase in nominal driving resistance will be determined by PDA. The pile shall be load tested again after 525\nthe appropriate waiting period. Load tests shall be repeated as many times as necessary\nuntil the pile carries the required load. The pile axial resistance will be determined from the test data in accordance with the Davisson Method as specified in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.   530 701.05\n615    2. Hydraulic Jacks, Pressure Gauges, and Load Cell\nHydraulic jacks and pressure gauges shall be used for the superimposed load. The jacks, pressure gauges, load cell, and hydraulic pumps shall be calibrated with each other within the last 30 days by an independent laboratory. When a jack, pressure gauge, load cell, and hydraulic pump are calibrated, they shall be calibrated and used 535\nas a unit. All calibration checks shall be within 5% of the applied load if calibrated as\na unit. Changing one of the four components shall require recalibration prior to use. Pressure gauges shall be a minimum of 4 1/2 in. in diameter with gradations in accordance with ASTM D1143. Hydraulic jacks shall have a nominal load capacity exceeding the maximum anticipated jack load by at least 20%. The jack, pump, any 540\nhoses, pipes, fittings, gauges, or transducers used shall be rated to a safe pressure corresponding to the nominal jack capacity. The Contractor shall provide copies of the most recent calibration certification a minimum of five days prior to the static load test.  545\n3. General Requirements  On completion of the static load test, a test pile or anchor pile which is not a part\nof the finished structure shall be removed or cut off at least 1 ft below either the bottom\nof footing or the finished ground elevation if not located within the footing area.  550\n701.06 Blank   701.07 Piling Length  The lengths of piles shown on the plans and in the Schedule of Pay Items are estimated lengths and are for bidding purposes only. The Contractor shall provide the 555\nactual length of piles necessary to obtain the nominal driving resistance and penetration depth required as determined from results obtained from driving representative test piles or other pertinent data. There will be expected variations in\nfinal tip elevations due to differences in nominal pile driving resistance. The final tip\nelevation of each pile will be determined during the driving operation. If minimum tip 560\nelevations are specified, the Contractor shall drive piles to a penetration depth that satisfies this requirement in addition to the nominal driving resistance. If no penetration depth or minimum tip elevation is specified, the pile shall be driven a minimum of 10 ft below the bottom of the footing elevation. The Contractor shall also furnish satisfactory evidence as to the identification, such as heat numbers for steel 565\npiles, of all portions of a built-up pile.\n701.08 Nominal Driving Resistance of Production Piles  Production piles shall be driven the depth necessary to obtain the required nominal driving resistance as determined by 701.05. If a minimum pile tip elevation is shown 570\non the plans, in addition to obtaining the required nominal driving resistance,\nproduction piles shall also be driven to the minimum pile tip elevation or to practical refusal.   When the nominal driving resistance is determined in accordance with 701.05(a) 575\nfor acceptance, the Engineer will record, at a minimum, the number of hammer blows 701.06\n616 per inch or per foot of pile movement for the last 24 in. of driving. When the nominal\ndriving resistance is determined in accordance with 701.05(b) for acceptance, the\nEngineer will record the blow count per inch or foot of pile movement, the associated\nhammer stroke for the last two consecutive feet of driving, and the final pile tip 580\nelevation in accordance with the pile driving criteria established through the dynamic\npile load test.\nPractical refusal will be defined as 20 blows per inch of penetration with the hammer operated at its maximum fuel or energy setting, or at a reduced fuel or energy 585\nsetting recommended by the Engineer based on pile installation stress control and less than 1/4 in. rebound per blow. The Contractor shall stop driving as soon as the Engineer determines that the pile has reached practical refusal.   The nominal driving resistance of jetted piles shall be based on impact driving 590\npenetration resistance after the jet pipes have been removed. Jetted piles not attaining the nominal driving resistance at the ordered length shall be spliced and driven with an impact hammer until the nominal driving resistance is achieved in accordance with\nthe driving criteria in 701.05.\n595\nThe required nominal driving resistance of piles driven with followers will only be considered acceptable if the piles with followers attain the same tip elevation as the full length piles driven without followers, installed in accordance with 701.04(c)5.   The required nominal driving resistance of piles driven with vibratory hammers 600\nshall be based on the driving resistance recorded during impact driving after the vibratory equipment has been removed from the first pile in each group of 10 piles. Vibrated piles not attaining the nominal driving resistance at the ordered length shall be spliced and driven with an impact hammer until the nominal driving resistance is\nachieved in accordance with the driving criteria in 701.05. Once the nominal driving 605\nresistance is attained, the remaining nine piles in the group shall be installed to similar penetration depths with similar vibratory hammer power consumption and rate of penetration as the first pile.   701.09 Preparation and Driving 610\nFor steel and timber piling, the pile heads shall be plane and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pile before the helmet is attached. The pile heads shall be protected with a hammer cushion.   Precast concrete pile heads shall be flat, smooth, and perpendicular to the 615\nlongitudinal axis of the pile. Prestressing strands shall be cut off below the surface of\nthe end of the pile. The pile head shall be chamfered on all sides. The heads of all\nconcrete piles shall be protected with a pile cushion.   Approval of a pile hammer relative to driving stress damage will not relieve the 620\nContractor of responsibility for piles damaged due to misalignment of the leads, failure of hammer cushion or cushion material, failure of splices, malfunctioning of the pile 701.09\n617 hammer, or improper construction methods. Piles damaged for such reasons will be\nrejected and shall be replaced if the Engineer determines that the damage impairs the strength of the pile. 625\n(a) Pilot Holes\nPilot holes are prebored, predrilled, or cored. After a pile is driven thru a pilot\nhole, all voids around the pile shall be filled with B borrow. Water shall be added to the hole to saturate the final placement of B borrow. 630\nIf the Engineer determines that preboring or predrilling has disturbed the nominal driving resistance of previously installed piles, those piles that have been disturbed shall be restored by means of redriving or other approved remedial measures. Redriving or other remedial measures shall be instituted after the preboring or 635\npredrilling operations in the area have been completed.     1. Preboring\nWhen shown on the plans, the Contractor shall prebore holes at the locations\nshown and to the depth specified. Prebored holes shall be 2 in. smaller than the 640\ndiameter or diagonal of the pile cross-section that is sufficient to allow penetration of the pile to the specified depth. If subsurface obstructions, such as boulders or rock layers, are encountered, the hole diameter may be increased to the least dimension which is adequate for pile installation.  645\nAugering, wet-rotary drilling, spudding, or other methods of preboring shall be used only when specified or approved in writing by the Engineer. The procedures shall be carried out so as not to impair the nominal driving resistance of the piles already in place or the safety of existing adjacent structures.\n650\nExcept for end bearing piles, preboring shall be stopped at least 5 ft above the pile\ntip elevation shown on the plans. The pile shall be driven with an impact hammer to\nthe specified penetration resistance. Where piles are to be end-bearing on rock or\nhardpan, preboring may be carried to the surface of the rock or hardpan. The piles shall then be driven with an impact hammer to ensure proper seating. 655\n2. Predrilling  The hole shall have a minimum diameter of not less than the greatest dimension of the pile cross-section plus 4 in. The holes shall be drilled to the elevations shown on the plans. 660\nBefore driving piles for end bents, holes to receive piling shall be predrilled or spudded through new embankment to the original ground elevation if the new embankment is 10 ft or more in height. If the new embankment is less than 10 ft in\nheight, predrilling is not required. If new embankment in the area of the end bents is 665\nto be constructed of sand, gravel, or other permeable material in which a predrilled hole would not remain open, the piling shall be driven before the embankment is constructed.  701.09\n618  Pilot holes for end bent piles for structures with integral end bents shall be 670\npredrilled to the depth specified in the plans, regardless of the height of new embankment.   If pile sleeves are shown on the plans, the drilled holes shall be sleeved to maintain\nthe opening during the driving of the piles. 675\nIf bentonite grout is shown on the plans, it shall be used to fill the annular space around the pile. The grout shall be placed at the depths shown on the plans or as directed. The entire annular space shall be filled from the bottom upwards to the top of the pile in one pumping operation using a tremie pipe. 680\nTremie pipe construction shall include side discharge ports. The tremie pipe can\nbe terminated by means of a tee connection. Tremie pipe may be PVC, however, joints shall not be glued or cemented.  685\n3. Cored Hole in Rock\nWhen specified, holes shall be cored into rock to accommodate pile placement.\nThe approach grade shall be completed before coring is begun. Holes of the diameter shown on the plans shall then be predrilled through the embankment into solid rock to the elevations shown on the plans or as otherwise directed. The piles shall be driven 690\nto practical refusal at the bottom of the cored holes. The holes in cored rock shall then be filled with concrete.    (b) Location and Alignment Tolerance\nA maximum deviation of 1 1/2 in. in any direction from the plan position will be 695\nallowed in pile trestle bents and exposed pile bents. A maximum deviation of 6 in. in\nany direction will be allowed for a foundation pile in footings for piers or abutments.\nThe tendency of concrete or steel piles to twist or rotate shall be prevented and\ncorrected. Piles to be swaybraced shall be aligned as necessary so that the swaybracing may be properly welded to the piles by a welder qualified in accordance with 711.32. 700\nNo pile shall be closer than 4 in. from an edge of the pile cap. Pulling or pushing laterally on installed piles to correct misalignment or splicing a properly aligned section on a misaligned section will not be allowed. The pile head at cutoff elevation shall be within 2 in. of plan elevation for bent caps supported by piles.  705\nPiles driven at integral end bents shall be installed so that the axial alignment of the top 10 ft of the pile is within 2% of the specified alignment.   Battered piles shall be installed so that the alignment of the top 10 ft of the pile\ndoes not vary by more than 3% from the batter rate shown on the plans. 710\nIf the location or alignment tolerances are exceeded, the extent of overloading shall be investigated. If the Engineer determines that corrective measures are necessary, such corrective measures shall be designed and constructed by the Contractor. Proposed corrective measures will be subject to approval by the Engineer. 715 701.09\n619\n(c) Heaved Piles\nThe Contractor shall take an elevation reading on each pile in a foundation immediately after each pile in that foundation has been driven and again after all piles in that foundation have been driven. Elevation readings for checking pile heave shall 720\ncontinue until the Engineer determines that such checking is no longer required. All\npiles which have heaved more than 1/4 in. shall be redriven to the required resistance or penetration. If pile heave is detected for pipe piles, the piles shall be redriven to original position prior to filling with concrete. A hammer-pile cushion system shall be submitted and approved prior to redriving pipe piles which have been filled with 725\nconcrete.    (d) Installation Sequence\nThe order of placing individual piles within a pile group shall begin from the center of the group and proceed outward in both directions unless an alternate 730\ninstallation sequence is approved in writing. For a bent with a single row of piles, pile driving shall begin at one end of the bent and proceed toward the opposite end.\n\n(e) Inspection\nThe Engineer shall be given a minimum of 24 h notice before driving piling. No 735\npile shall be driven except in the presence of the Engineer.   Prior to placing concrete in driven pipe piles, the Contractor shall supply suitable lighting for the inspection of each pipe pile by the Engineer throughout its entire length. 740\n(f) Pouring Concrete\nAfter all water and other foreign substances have been removed from the pipe\npiles and the final approval given, reinforcing bars, if specified, shall be placed and\nthe pipe piles shall be filled with Class A concrete in the presence of the Engineer. 745\nConcrete shall be deposited into pipe piles in a stream with a cross-sectional area that\nis no more than approximately 50% of the area of the pipe pile to prevent air pockets from forming. At a minimum, concrete shall be vibrated in the upper 25 ft of the pipe piles. Concrete shall not be placed in pipe piles until all pile driving has progressed beyond a radius of 15 ft from the pile to be filled. All pile driving within the above 750\nlimits shall be discontinued until the concrete in the last pile cast has cured for a minimum of 48 h.   701.10 Unsatisfactory Piles  The method used in driving piles shall not subject the piles to excessive or undue 755\nabuse which produces deformation of the steel, injurious splitting, splintering, and brooming of the wood, or crushing and spalling of the concrete. All piles damaged\nduring driving due to internal defects, improper driving, being driven out of its proper\nlocation, or being driven below the designated cutoff elevation shall be corrected as directed. 760\nPiles which have been bent, or otherwise damaged, during installation shall be 701.10\n620 considered unsatisfactory unless the nominal driving resistance is proven by load tests\nperformed by the Contractor. If such tests indicate inadequate pile resistance, corrective measures such as the use of the bent piles at reduced pile resistance, 765\ninstallation of additional piles, strengthening of the bent piles, or replacement of the\nbent piles shall be performed as approved by the Engineer.\n\nA concrete pile will be considered defective if a visible crack appears around the entire periphery of the pile or if a defect is observed, as determined by the Engineer. 770\n701.11 Splicing Piles  Full length piles shall be placed in the leads if practical. However, if splicing is necessary, the following methods shall be used.  775\n(a) Steel Piles\nSplicing of steel piles shall be made as shown on the plans. The top of the pile to be extended shall be restored to its original cross-section shape. The mating end of the other pile shall be beveled as shown on the plans. A wire brush or grinder shall be used\nto remove any scale, dirt, slag, or other foreign material that is detrimental to 780\nfabricating a sound weld from all surfaces to be welded. For H piles, a mechanical splice shall not be used within 20 ft of the ground surface unless it is proven that the splice can transfer the full pile strength in compression, tension, and bending. Splices for pipe piles shall be watertight. All work shall be done with approved methods and materials and by welders qualified in accordance with 711.32. If the temperature of 785\nthe piles is below 50\u00b0F, both piles to be spliced shall be preheated to a minimum temperature of 70\u00b0F in the vicinity of the splice immediately prior to welding. The temperature of the piles shall be maintained at a minimum of 50\u00b0F until the welding is complete. There shall not be more than two splices exposed to view in each length\nof piling after driving is completed. A mechanical splice shall not be used in integral 790\nend bents.\n(b) Timber Piles\nTimber piles shall not be spliced.\n795\n(c) Concrete Piles\nFull length concrete piles shall be used where practical. If splicing is necessary, concrete splice details shall conform to the contract documents. Mechanical splices including drive-fit splices may also be used if the splice can transfer the full pile strength in compression, tension and bending. 800\n701.12 Blank\n\n701.13 Cut-Off Lengths  The tops of all steel pile shall be cut off at the elevation shown on the plans. All 805\nunused cut-off lengths shall become the property of the Contractor and shall be removed from the project site.  701.13\n621  The length of timber pile above the elevation of cut-off shall be sufficient to\nenable the complete removal of all material injured by driving. Immediately after 810\nmaking final cut-off on treated timber foundation piles, the cut area shall be treated\nwith copper naphthenate in accordance with AWPA Standard M4.\nTimber piling supporting timber structures where the piles are cut off, but not\nconcrete capped, shall be treated with copper naphthenate in accordance with AWPA 815\nStandard M4. A layer of saturated building felt or fiberglass cloth which overlaps the side of the pile at least 2 in. shall be securely fastened and completely covered with 20 gauge thick galvanized metal or aluminum sheeting. All cuts, injuries, and holes, which occur from removal of nails or spikes that penetrate the treating zone as well as bolt holes for connections, shall be treated by applying coal-tar roof cement in 820\naccordance with ASTM D5643.   701.14 Method of Measurement  The driven length of treated timber piles, untreated timber piles, steel pipe piles, steel H piles, and concrete piles will be measured by the linear foot to the nearest 0.1 ft. 825\nThis includes piles used as indicator test piles, dynamic test piles, or static load test\npiles. Measurement will be made only for the actual number of linear feet of piling complete in place.

All cement damaged\nby moisture or which fails to meet the specified requirements shall be rejected and 65\nremoved from the work. Cement stored for a period longer than 60 calendar days shall be retested before being used on the work.    Cement of different brands, types, or from different mills shall be stored separately. 70\n\nCONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS\n702.05 Proportioning  Control of PCC for air content, slump, or relative yield will be determined from 75\ntests performed by the Engineer. Concrete and necessary labor for sampling shall be\nfurnished by the Contractor as required by the Engineer. Testing will be in accordance\nwith the Frequency Manual.   A CMDS shall be submitted seven calendar days prior to production and be 80\napproved by the Engineer on the Department provided spreadsheet. The absolute\nvolume of the mix design shall be 27.0 cu ft at the design air content of 6.5%.   The aggregate blend on the CMDS may produce an optimized aggregate gradation in accordance with the Department provided spreadsheet. If an optimized aggregate 85\ngradation is used, it shall consist of, at a minimum, one concrete coarse aggregate and\none fine aggregate, No. 23. One additional Class A or higher for exposed or Class B\nor higher for non-exposed intermediate-sized coarse aggregate may be included if\napproved by the Engineer.  90\nThe proportion of ingredients of each ba tch shall be within the following limits\nand shall be as approved.   The relative yield of the concrete shall be determined in accordance with 505. The concrete when produced shall provide a relative yield of 1.00 \u00b10.02. When the relative 95\nyield is outside the tolerances, adjustments to the batch weights shall be made. The minimum amount of cement shall be used for the desired class of concrete. The cement content shall not be increased more than 60 lb/cu yd. The relative yield of the concrete shall be maintained as stated above. If Type IP or Type IP-A cements are to be used\nin the structural concrete, the cement content shall be increased by a multiplier of 1.06 100\ntimes the minimum amount of cement required or the desired increased cement content for the specified class of concrete.\nFor example: 1.06 x 564 = 598 lb/cu yd for Class A concrete.  105 702.05\n627  Coal ash from a qualified source may be used as a partial replacement for portland\ncement. The substitution of coal ash for portland cement will not be allowed in\nconjunction with the use of slag cement or blended cement types IP, IP-A, IS, or IS-A.\nMix designs will be based on using a maximum 20% cement reduction with a minimum 1.25:1 ash-to-cement replacement ratio, by weight. 110\n\nSlag cement from a qualified source may be used as a partial replacement for portland cement. The substitution of slag cement for portland cement will not be allowed in conjunction with the use of blended cement types IP, IP-A, IS, IS-A, or\ncoal ash. Mix designs will be based on using a maximum 30% cement substitution 115\nwith a 1:1 slag-to-cement ratio, by weight.   Slag cement or silica fume in accordance with 709.05(c) shall be used in all bridge decks, reinforced concrete bridge approaches, and terminal joint lugs.  120\nBlended portland pozzolan cements, coal ash, and slag cement may be used in\nconcrete when the ambient temperature is above 45\u00b0F during the entire placement\nperiod. Immediately following placement, the average ambient temperature shall be\nabove 45\u00b0F for the entire curing period. The average temperature shall be calculated based on hourly temperature measurements taken at the jobsite or from published 125\nweather station data within 10 miles of the jobsite. If the temperature restrictions are not met during placement or during the required curing period, curing shall continue and the element shall not be put into service until the strength requirements in accordance with 702.24 are met. If no test specimens are available to determine the\nconcrete strength, curing shall continue and the concrete will be considered as failed 130\nmaterial and will be reviewed in accordance with 105.03. In no case shall the curing\nperiod be reduced below the minimum number of days specified for the element.\nAll concrete shall have an air content of 6.5% \u00b11.5% by volume. Air content shall\nbe determined in accordance with 505.  135\nPowdered admixtures shall be measured by weight. Paste or liquid admixtures shall be measured by weight or volume. All admixtures shall be within 3% of the amount required. When admixtures are used in small quantities in proportion to the cement, as is the case for air-entraining admixtures, mechanical dispensing equipment 140\nshall be provided.\nClass C concrete shall contain a retarding admixture when either the air temperature is above 70\u00b0F or the concrete temperature is above 80\u00b0F, or if retardation is required due to the structure design, or due to the proposed pour sequence such as 145\nfor the requirements for floor slab pours set out in 704.04. Air-entraining cements will\nnot be allowed in Class C concrete.\nIf the contract requires stay-in-place metal forms for the bridge deck or if the\nContractor elects to use such forms, the bridge deck concrete shall incorporate Class 150\nAP coarse aggregate instead of Class A. 702.05\n628\n702.06 Measuring and Batching  Unless otherwise specified, the minimum batch shall be 2 cu yds. Measuring and batching of materials shall be performed at a batching plant. Different kinds or sources 155\nof coarse aggregate or different brands of cement shall not be used in any unit of the\nstructure, except in an emergency and with written approval.\n(a) Portland Cement  Either sacked or bulk cement may be used. No fraction of a sack of cement shall 160\nbe used in a batch of concrete unless the cement is weighed. All bulk cement shall be weighed on an approved weighing device. The bulk cement weighing hopper shall be sealed and vented to preclude dusting during operation. The discharge chute shall not be suspended from the weighing hopper and shall be arranged so that cement does not\nlodge in it or leak from it. Accuracy of batching shall be \u00b11% of the required weight. 165\n\nIf coal ash is used as a pozzolan in portland cement concrete, the cement and coal ash shall be weighed and discharged separately when a manual operation is utilized.\nWhen an automatic batching plant is utilized, the coal ash may be weighed into the cement weigh hopper in one cumulative operation with the portland cement always 170\nbeing weighed in first.\n(b) Water\nWater may be measured either by volume or by weight. The accuracy of measuring the water shall be within 1% of the required amount. 175\n(c) Aggregates  The batch plant site, layout, equipment, and provisions for transporting material shall assure a continuous supply of reasonably uniform material to the work.\nAggregate stockpiles shall be in areas sufficiently well drained to prevent any dirt 180\nunderneath the stockpile from becoming softened and pumping into the aggregate to a level from which the aggregate is to be removed and used in the work. Stockpiles shall be built in layers not to exceed 6 ft in depth. Upper layers shall be prevented from spilling over the sides of the layers below.  185\nThe removal of aggregates from stockpiles shall be performed so that segregation will not occur. Aggregate which has become mixed with dirt shall not be used in the work.   Washed aggregates shall drain for at least 12 h prior to use. An increase in the 190\ndrainage time may be required, as directed, at any time when the moisture becomes\nnon-uniform in aggregates from any source. Aggregates from different sources shall\nnot be stockpiled together without written approval.   Batching shall be conducted to obtain the weights of materials required within a 195\ntolerance of \u00b12%.  702.06\n629   (d) Bins and Scales\nThe batching plant shall include bins, weighing hoppers, and scales for the fine aggregate and for each size of coarse aggregate. If cement is used in bulk, a bin, 200\nhopper, and scale for cement shall be included. If coal ash is used, the separation of\ncement and coal ash bins will be as approved. Bins with adequate separate\ncompartments for fine aggregate and for each size of coarse aggregate shall be\nprovided in the batching plant.  205\nMeans of control shall be provided so that as the quantity required in the weighing hopper is approached the material may be added slowly and shut off with precision. A port or other opening for removing an overload from the hopper shall be provided. A port for sampling cement shall be provided and may be either the overload port or a separate port located at any point from the bottom of the storage bin to the weigh 210\nhopper. The sampling port shall be located and constructed to provide a representative sample of the cement being used. Weighing hoppers shall be constructed to eliminate accumulation of tare materials and to discharge fully.\nFor applied loads of 1,000 lb and greater on the cement scale and applied loads of 215\n4,000 lb and greater on the aggregate scale, the scales shall be accurate to 0.5%. For applied loads of less than 1,000 lb and 4,000 lb for the cement and aggregate scales, respectively, the scales shall be accurate to 2.0% or one graduation, whichever is larger. Poises shall be designed to be locked in any position to prevent unauthorized change of position. Scales will be inspected as often as necessary to ensure their 220\ncontinued accuracy. A minimum of ten 50 lb weights shall be provided for testing of\nscales.   Batching plants may be equipped with approved automatic weighing devices to proportion aggregates and bulk cement. 225\n\n(e) Batching\nWhen batches are hauled to the mixer, bulk cement shall be transported either in waterproof compartments or between the fine and coarse aggregates. When cement is placed in contact with the aggregates, batches may be rejected unless mixed within 230\n1 1/2 h of such contact. Sacked cement may be transported on top of the aggregates.   Batches shall be delivered to the mixer separate and intact. Each batch shall be dumped cleanly into the mixer without loss and, when more than one batch is carried on the truck, without spillage of material from one batch compartment into another. 235\n702.07 Mixing\nConcrete may be mixed at the site of construction, at a central point, or wholly or\nin part in truck mixers. Retempering concrete by adding water or by other means will not be allowed after initial set. When the concrete is delivered in transit mixers and 240\nwhen allowed, additional water may be added occasionally to increase the slump.\nWhen water is added to the mix, additional mixing shall be performed as directed with\nall operations completed within the time limits in accordance with 702.09(c). The 702.07\n630 amount of water added shall be determined accurately and noted on the batch ticket.\nSuch addition of water will not be allowed as a continuing operation. The total of all 245\nwater included in the mix shall not exceed the maximum in accordance with 702.02.   Concrete that is outside the specified slump limits at time of placement shall not\nbe used. Except as required in 702.05 for Class C concrete, chemical admixtures Type\nA, Type B, Type D, Type F, and Type G may be used in the concrete. Chemical 250\nadmixtures Type C and Type E will be allowed only with prior written permission.    702.08 Mixing at Site of Work  For concrete to be acceptable, no more than 1 h shall elapse from the time mixing water has entered the mixer until the mixed batch is deposited into the forms. 255\nThe concrete shall be mixed in an approved batch mixer having a rated capacity of no less than 188 lb except for pours of 20 cu yds or less, or where otherwise specified, a 94 lb minimum capacity mixer may be used. Mixers shall produce a uniform distribution of ingredients throughout the mass. No mixer shall be operated 260\nbeyond its factory rated capacity.\nThe concrete shall be mixed no less than 60 s after all ingredients, including water, are in the mixer. During the period of mixing, the drum shall rotate at the speed for\nwhich it was designed. The speed of the drum shall be no less than 14 and no more 265\nthan 20 revolutions per minute. If this procedure does not mix the concrete thoroughly, a sufficient additional number of turns at the same rate shall be made until a thorough mixing of the ingredients is obtained.   The mixer shall be equipped with a batch meter for counting the number of 270\nbatches discharged and a timer for automatically locking the discharge chute to prevent\nemptying the mixer prior to the specified minimum mixing time. Mixers shall be\nequipped with mechanical means for preventing the addition of ingredients, including water, after mixing is started. The first batch shall contain an additional quantity of cement, fine aggregate, and water sufficient to coat the inside surface of the drum to 275\navoid diminishing the mortar content of the initial batch. The entire contents of the drum shall be removed before the materials for the next batch are introduced. Upon cessation of mixing for any considerable time, the drum shall be cleaned thoroughly.\nStructural concrete shall be mixed only in such quantities as required for 280\nimmediate use and shall be placed while fresh and before initial set has occurred. Hand\nmixing will not be allowed except in an emergency and then only with permission. Hand mixing shall be done on a watertight platform in such manner and so continued\nto ensure a homogeneous mixture of the required consistency. Hand mixed batches\nshall not exceed 1/2 cu yd in volume. 285\n702.09 Ready-Mixed Concrete\n\n(a) General Requirements\nReady-mixed concrete shall be mixed and delivered by means of one of the 290 702.09\n631 following operations:\n1. Mixed completely in a stationary mixer and the mixed concrete\ntransported to the point of delivery in a truck-agitator or truck-mixer at agitating speed or in non-agitating equipment in 295\naccordance with 702.09(d). Concrete delivered under these\nprovisions shall be known as central-mixed concrete.\n2. Mixed partially in a stationary mixer and the mixing completed\nin a truck-mixer. Concrete delivered under these provisions 300\nshall be known as shrink-mixed concrete.\n3. Mixed completely in a truck-mixer. Concrete delivered under\nthese conditions shall be known as transit-mixed concrete.\n305\nThe source of ready-mixed concrete shall be approved prior to delivery of the concrete. This approval will be based on the capacity and condition of the equipment,\nvolume of production, and length of haul, with consideration of the use of the concrete.\nOriginal approval will not constitute continued approval if satisfactory concrete or rate of delivery is not maintained. 310\nApproval may be refused or previous approval may be withdrawn for a truck\nmixer or for a part of equipment not functioning in such a manner as to produce and\ndeliver uniform concrete to the site of the work at a uniform rate.  315\nBefore a pour is started, the number of trucks to be assigned to the work, the rate of production, and all other conditions necessary for furnishing satisfactory concrete shall be subject to approval. Such assigned equipment shall be in satisfactory operating\ncondition prior to the start of the pour. Once assigned to a pour, equipment shall not\nbe diverted for another purpose without approval. 320\n(b) Mixers and Agitators\nMixers and agitators shall be in accordance with the following:     1. Mixers may be stationary mixers or truck-mixers. Agitators 325\nmay be truck-mixers or truck-agitators. Each mixer and agitator shall have attached metal plates, prominently placed and plainly\nmarked, indicating the various designed uses of the equipment,\nthe volume capacity of mixed concrete, the speed of rotation of\nthe mixing drum, and the manufacturer\u2019s name and address. 330\nStationary mixers shall be equipped with an acceptable timing\ndevice which does not enable the batch to be discharged until the specified mixing time has elapsed. Truck-mixers shall be equipped with means by which the number of revolutions of the drum may be verified readily. The counters shall be actuated at 335\nthe time of starting mixing at mixing speed. 702.09\n632\n2. The mixer, when loaded to the manufacturer\u2019s rated capacity\nwithout overload, shall be capable of combining the ingredients of the concrete within the specified time into a thoroughly 340\nmixed and uniform mass and of discharging the concrete with a\nsatisfactory degree of uniformity in accordance with\n702.09(b)4.\n3. The agitator, when loaded to the manufacturer\u2019s rated capacity 345\nwithout overload, shall be capable of maintaining the mixed concrete in a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass and of discharging the concrete with a satisfactory degree of uniformity in accordance with 702.09(b)4.\n350\n4. Slump tests may be made of individual samples taken when\ndischarged at approximately the 1/4 and 3/4 points of each load. If the slumps differ by more than 1 in. when the average slump\nis 3 in. or less, or by more than 2 in. when the average slump is\ngreater than 3 in., the mixer or agitator shall not be used until 355\nconditions are corrected, except as set out in 702.09(b)5.\n5. Use of equipment may be allowed when operations with a\nlonger mixing time or with a smaller load will enable the\nrequirements in 702.09(b)4 to be met. 360\n6. Mixers and agitators shall be examined daily for changes in\nconditions due to the accumulations of hardened concrete or mortar or to wear of blades. When such change of conditions is\nfound, the tests described in 702.09(b)4 shall be repeated. 365\n(c) Mixing and Delivery\nMixers and agitators shall be operated within the limits of the capacity and speed of rotations designated by the manufacturer. The following shall apply in fulfilling these requirements. 370\n1. The complete mixing time for a stationary mixer shall be no less\nthan 60 s. Mixing time shall be measured from the time all cement and aggregates are in the drum. The batch shall be so charged into the mixer that some of the water enters in advance 375\nof the cement and aggregates. All required water shall be in the\ndrum by the end of the first quarter of the specified mixing time.\n2. If a stationary mixer is used for shrink mixing, the time in the\nstationary mixer may be reduced to the minimum required to 380\nmix the ingredients, or approximately 30 s. Mixing shall then be completed in a truck-mixer by no less than 50 and no more 702.09\n633 than 100 revolutions of the drum or blades at the rate of rotation\ndesignated by the manufacturer of the equipment as mixing speed. Additional mixing, if required, shall be at the speed 385\ndesignated by the manufacturer as agitating speed.\n\n3. If the concrete is mixed in a truck-mixer loaded to its rated\ncapacity, the number of revolutions of the drum or blades at mixing speed shall be no less than 70 and no more than 100, but 390\nnot less than that recommended by the mixer manufacturer.\n4. If a truck-mixer or truck-agitator is used for transporting\nconcrete that has been completely mixed in a stationary mixer, further mixing during transportation shall be at the speed 395\ndesignated by the manufacturer of the equipment as agitating speed.\n5. If a truck-mixer or truck-agitator is used for transporting\nconcrete, the concrete shall be delivered to the site of the work 400\nand its discharge completed within 90 minutes after the introduction of the mixing water to the cement and aggregates, or the introduction of cement to the aggregates, unless a shorter time is otherwise specified. When a truck-mixer is used for the complete mixing of the concrete, the mixing operations shall 405\nbegin within 30 minutes after the cement has been added to the aggregates.\n6. When authorized, a truck-mixer may be charged with\naggregates and water at the batching plant and with bagged 410\ncement at the point of delivery, provided the truck-mixer is then\noperated at mixing speed for the required additional revolutions and satisfactory concrete is produced.\n7. For truck-mixers, wash water shall not be used as a portion of 415\nthe mixing water for succeeding batches.\n(d) Non-Agitating Equipment\nCentral mixed concrete may be transported from the mixing plant to the place of use in non-agitating equipment as approved. The following shall apply in fulfilling 420\nthese requirements.\n1.

Discharge 430\nshall be completed within 30 minutes after the introduction of the mixing water to the cement and aggregates.\n\n3. Slump tests shall be taken in accordance with 702.09(b)4. If the\nslump differs by more than these tolerances the non-agitating 435\nequipment shall not be used until the conditions are corrected in accordance with 702.09(d)4.\n4. If the requirements of 702.09(d)3 are not met when the non-\nagitating equipment is operated at minimum capacity for the 440\nmaximum time of haul and with the concrete mixed the minimum time, the equipment may still be used when operated using smaller loads, shorter hauls, or longer mixing times, or\ncombinations thereof, in accordance with 702.09(d)3.\n445\n702.10 Pumping Concrete\nIf the Contractor elects to convey concrete by means of pumping, the concrete shall be handled to minimize disturbance to the concrete which significantly alters the properties of the concrete being pumped, especially the loss or variability of the air content. The pumping equipment shall be mechanically sound, suitable in kind, and 450\nadequate in capacity for the proposed work. The concrete shall not be pumped through aluminum or aluminum alloy pipe. All pipes used for pumping concrete shall be kept clean and free from coatings of hardened concrete. Pump lines shall not rest directly on epoxy coated reinforcing bars. The pumping equipment shall be located such that\noperational vibrations will not damage freshly placed concrete. 455\n\nWhen placing concrete directly from a truck mounted boom, the concrete pump\nlines shall have a flexible end section at least 10 ft long. Methods of placement shall result in a steady and continuous discharge. If necessary, this may require the use of a restrictive device at or near the end of the discharge tube, the laying the flexible end 460\nsection horizontally, or other means. For the initial placement of concrete pours which are predominantly vertical, the discharge end of the flexible end section shall be within 2 ft of the bottom of the pour.\nThe Contractor shall submit a description of the pumping procedures intended to 465\nbe used and notify the Engineer of those procedure at least 24 h in advance of concrete\nplacement.\n\n702.11 Cold Weather Concrete\nWhen it is necessary to place concrete at or below an atmospheric temperature of 470\n40\u00b0F, or whenever it is determined that the temperature may fall below 40\u00b0F within\nthe curing period, the water, the aggregates, or both shall be heated and suitable enclosures and heating devices provided. Cold weather concrete shall be placed at the risk of the Contractor and shall be removed and replaced with no additional payment if it becomes frozen or otherwise damaged. 475 702.11\n635\nWhen aggregates or water are heated, the resulting concrete shall have a\ntemperature of at least 50\u00b0F and not more than 80\u00b0F at the time of placing. Heating equipment or methods which alter or prevent the entrainment of the required amount of air in the concrete shall not be used. The equipment shall be capable of heating the 480\nmaterials uniformly. Neither aggregates nor water used for mixing shall be heated to a temperature exceeding 150\u00b0F. When aggregates or water are heated to 100\u00b0F or\nabove, they shall be combined first in the mixer before the cement is added. The\nmaximum temperature of concrete produced with heated aggregates shall be 90\u00b0F.\nMaterials containing frost or lumps of frozen material shall not be used.  485\nStockpiled aggregates may be heated using dry heat or steam. Aggregates shall not be heated directly by gas or oil flame or on sheet metal over fire. However, a drier may be used if approved.  490\nWhen aggregates are heated in bins, steam-coil heating, water-coil heating, or\nother methods which are not detrimental to the aggregates may be used. The use of salt or other chemicals to accelerate hardening of the concrete will not be allowed unless approved in writing.\n495\nImmediately after a pour is completed, the freshly poured concrete and forms shall be covered to form a complete protective enclosure around the element being poured. If the element is a bridge deck, the enclosure shall encompass the top, bottom, and all sides. The air within the entire enclosure shall be maintained at a temperature above 50\u00b0F for a minimum of 144 h for bridge decks, the top surface of reinforced concrete 500\nslab bridges, and for a minimum of 72 h for all other concrete. If for any reason this minimum temperature is not maintained, the heating period shall be extended. When dry heat is used, means shall be provided to maintain adequate moisture in the air within the enclosure.  505\nAll necessary measures shall be taken during protective heating to keep the\nheating equipment in continuous operation and to maintain the proper temperature around all sides, including the top and bottom of the concrete. Adequate fire protection shall be provided where heating is in progress and such protection shall be accessible at all times. 510\nWhere practicable, forms insulated with at least 2 in. thick blankets made of fiberglass, rock wool, balsam wool, or similar commercial material capable of maintaining the surface of the concrete at no less than 50\u00b0F may be used in lieu of other protection of concrete involving housing and heating. When forms are insulated, 515\nexposed horizontal surfaces shall be protected with a similar layer of the insulating material fastened securely in place. If the insulated forms do not maintain the proper\ntemperature at the surface of the concrete, auxiliary protection and heat shall be used.\n702.12 Consistency 520\nSlump will be measured in accordance with 505 and shall be no less than 1 in. and no more than 6 in. 702.12\n636\n702.13 Forms\n525\n(a) Construction\nForms shall be mortar-tight and sufficiently rigid to prevent distortion due to the pressure of the concrete and other loads incident to the construction operations, including vibration. Forms shall be constructed and maintained to prevent the opening of joints due to shrinkage of the lumber. 530\n\nUnless otherwise provided, all forms for exposed surfaces except the undersides of girders, slabs, and arch rings shall be lined with approved plywood, metal, or similar satisfactory composition. The lining shall not be sprung into place. Before concrete is placed, all open joints shall be filled with a satisfactory filler which is impervious to 535\nmoisture, does not stain or otherwise injure the concrete, and produces a tight joint. The lining shall present a smooth uniform surface. Lining of sufficient thickness to resist the pressure of the concrete without deflection may be applied directly to the studding if it otherwise complies with the foregoing provisions for form lining.  540\nIn designing forms, fresh concrete shall be considered as a liquid weighing\n150 lb/cu ft for vertical loads and 100 lb/cu ft for horizontal pressure. A live load\nallowance of 50 lb/sq ft shall be used on horizontal projections of surfaces. The scheme of formwork for work on a span over active railroad tracks shall provide a horizontal clearance of not less than 8 ft from the centerline of track and a clearance height of not 545\nless than 22 ft from the top of the track rail.   Spreader blocks and bracing shall be removed from the inside of the forms before concrete is placed and no portion of wood shall be left in the concrete.  550\nForms for exposed concrete edges shall be chamfered 3/4 in. Forms shall be given a bevel or draft in the case of all projections, such as girders and copings, to ensure\neasy removal.\n\n(b) Ties 555\nApproved ties or anchorages within the forms shall be so constructed as to enable\ntheir removal to a depth of at least 1 in. from the face without injury to the concrete. Ties may be metal or fiberglass. Ties shall be capable of supporting the designed loads. Fiberglass ties shall be ground flush with the face of the concrete surfaces.   560\nThe cavities shall be filled with cement mortar and the surface left sound, smooth, even, and uniform in color. Filling of the cavities will not be required between the fascia beams or girders on the underside of decks, the bottom surface of slab decks, or the bottom deck surface of box culverts. In general, tie rods shall be designed to also act as struts or spreaders. The use of wood struts will not be allowed in copings, 565\nrailings, and walls less than 2 ft thick. Devices which, when removed, leave an opening\nentirely through the concrete will not be allowed unless approved in writing. Wire ties\nshall not be used.  702.13\n637   (c) Walls 570\nWhere the bottom of the forms is inaccessible, the lower form boards shall be left loose or other provisions made so that extraneous material may be removed from the forms immediately before placing the concrete.\n(d) Surface Treatment 575\nAll forms shall be treated with a formulated form coating that allows them to be released without adhering, discoloring, or otherwise damaging the concrete.    (e) Metal Forms  580\n1. Removable  The specifications for forms as they regard design, mortar tightness, filleted corners, beveled projections, bracing, alignment, removal, re-use, and oiling apply to metal forms. The metal used for forms shall be of such thickness that the forms remain true to shape. All bolt and rivet heads shall be countersunk. Clamps, pins, or other 585\nconnecting devices shall be designed to hold the forms together rigidly and to allow\nremoval without injury to the concrete. Metal forms which do not present a smooth\nsurface or do not line up properly shall not be used. Care shall be exercised to keep metal forms free from rust, grease, or other foreign matter.  590\n2. Permanent\nFabricated permanent metal forms for concrete deck slabs may be used as an alternate method of forming on a steel beam, steel girder, prestressed concrete I-beam, prestressed concrete spread box beam, or prestressed concrete bulb-T beam bridge. Permanent metal forms shall not be removed and shall otherwise be in accordance with 595\nthe applicable requirements of this section.\nThe metal forms shall be designed based on dead load of the forms, reinforcing\nbars, and plastic concrete plus 50 lb/sq ft for construction loads. The unit working stress in the steel sheet shall be not more than 0.725 of the specified minimum yield 600\nstrength of the material furnished but not to exceed 36,000 psi. Deflection under the weight of the forms, the plastic concrete, and the reinforcing bars shall not exceed 1/180 of the form span or 1/2 in., whichever is less. However, the deflection loading\nshall not be less than 120 lb/sq ft total. The allowable form camber shall be based on\nthe actual dead load condition. Camber shall not be used to compensate for deflection 605\nin excess of the foregoing limits. The design span of the form sheets shall be the clear span of the form plus 2 in. measured parallel to the form flutes. If the design span of the form sheets exceeds 9.5 ft, concrete will not be allowed to be placed in the valleys of the corrugations of the metal forms. Physical design properties shall be computed\nin accordance with requirements of the American Iron and Steel Institute 610\nSpecifications for the Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members.   All reinforcing bars shall have a minimum clearance of 1 in. from the forms. The plan dimensions from the top surface for all primary deck reinforcing bars shall be\nmaintained. The deck reinforcing bars shall be tied down at a maximum of 6 ft centers. 615 702.13\n638 Permanent metal forms shall not remain in place closer than 1 ft from any joint exposed\nto the underside of the slab, except when an overlay is used on the deck.   Fabricator\u2019s working drawings shall be submitted for approval. These drawings shall indicate the grade of steel and the physical and section properties for all 620\npermanent metal bridge deck form sheets. If the bridge is a steel beam or steel girder\nstructure, these drawings shall also include a clear indication of locations where the forms are supported by steel beam flanges subject to tensile stress. The drawings shall be certified by a registered professional engineer prior to submittal.\n625\nForm sheets shall not rest directly on the top of the beam flanges. Sheets shall be securely fastened to the form supports and shall have a minimum bearing length of 1 in. at each end. All attachments shall be made by welds, bolts, clips, or other approved means. Except as amended by these specifications, welding and welds shall be in accordance with the requirements of 711.32 pertaining to fillet welds. However, 630\n1/8 in. fillet welds will be allowed. The vertical leg of angles used as form supports\nshall not extend higher than the top of the permanent metal form.\n\nForm supports at steel beam or girder bridges shall be placed in direct contact with the top flange of the beam or girder and shall be adjusted to maintain the required deck 635\nthickness. If straps are used on the top flanges, the straps shall be No. 8 gauge thick, fit tight, and shall not be galvanized. Form supports shall not be welded to flanges of non-weldable grades of steel or to steel flanges subject to tensile stresses.   Form supports at prestressed concrete I-beam, prestressed concrete spread box 640\nbeam, and prestressed concrete bulb-T beam bridges shall be placed in direct contact\nwith the sides of the box or edge of the I-beam or bulb-T beam flange and shall be adjusted to maintain the required deck thickness. The form supports may be attached\nto steel inserts cast into the top of the box, I-beam, bulb-T beam, straps extending\nacross the top of the flange, hangers mechanically attached to reinforcing bars 645\nextending from the top flange, or by other approved methods. If straps are used across the top flange, they shall be No. 8 gauge thick, fit tight, and shall not be galvanized.\nAttachments shall not be welded directly to beam reinforcement. In addition, the use of recesses cast into the beam to serve as form supports will not be allowed.  650\nAll permanently exposed form metal, where the galvanized coating has been damaged, shall be thoroughly and satisfactorily cleaned, wire brushed, and painted with two coats of zinc oxide-zinc dust primer in accordance with Federal Specification MIL-P-2441, Type II, with no color added. Minor heat discoloration in areas of welds need not be touched up. 655\n\nConcrete shall be placed in accordance with 702.20. Particular emphasis shall be placed on proper vibration of the concrete to avoid honeycombs and voids, especially at construction joints, expansion joints, attachment hardware, and valleys and ends of form sheets. Pouring sequences, procedures, and mixes shall be submitted for 660\napproval. 702.13\n639\nIf it is determined that the procedures used during the placement of the concrete warrant inspection of the underside of the deck, at least one section of the forms shall be removed at a location and time selected for each span in the contract. This is to be 665\ndone as soon after placing the concrete as practical to provide visual evidence that the\nconcrete mix and the procedures are obtaining the desired results. An additional\nsection shall be removed if it is determined that there has been any change in the concrete mix or in the procedures warranting additional inspection.  670\nAfter the deck concrete has been in place for a minimum of two days, the concrete shall be tested for soundness and bonding to the forms by sounding with a hammer as directed. If areas of doubtful soundness are detected by this procedure, the forms shall be removed from such areas for visual inspection after the pour has attained adequate strength. This removal of the permanent metal bridge deck forms shall be with no 675\nadditional payment. At locations where sections of the forms are removed, form replacement will not be required, but the adjacent metal forms and supports shall be repaired to present a neat appearance and ensure their satisfactory retention. As soon\nas the form is removed, the concrete surfaces will be examined for cavities,\nhoneycombs, and other defects. If irregularities are found, and it is determined that 680\nthese irregularities do not justify rejection of the work, the concrete shall be repaired as directed and shall be given a finish in accordance with 702.21.    If the concrete where the form is removed is unsatisfactory, additional forms, as necessary, shall be removed to inspect and repair the slab, and the methods of 685\nconstruction shall be modified as required to obtain satisfactory concrete in the slab. All unsatisfactory concrete shall be removed or repaired as directed.   The amount of sounding and form removal may be moderated as directed after a\nsubstantial amount of slab has been constructed and inspected, if the methods of 690\nconstruction and the results of the inspections as outlined above indicate that sound concrete is being obtained throughout the slabs. All necessary facilities shall be\nprovided for the safe and convenient performance of inspection procedures.    (f) Blank 695\n(g) Removal and Re-Use of Forms\nThe forms for any portion of the structure shall not be removed until the concrete is strong enough to withstand damage.   700\nIf field operations are not controlled by beam or cylinder tests, the following\nperiods, exclusive of days when the ambient temperature is below 40\u00b0F, for removal\nof forms and supports may be used as a guide.    Centering under beams .................................................... 15 days 705\nRoadway Slabs ................................................................ 7 days   Walls, Columns, Sides of Beams, and all other parts ........ 12 h 702.13\n640\nIf high-early strength cement is used, these periods may be reduced as directed. If\nportland-pozzolan cement, types IP or IP-A, coal ash or slag cement is used in the 710\nstructural concrete as a pozzolan, these periods shall not apply and the removal of\nforms and supports shall be controlled by test beams in accordance with 702.13(h).\n\nTo obtain a satisfactory surface finish, forms for railings, parapets, and exposed vertical surfaces shall be removed no less than 12 h and no more than 48 h after the 715\nconcrete is placed, depending on weather conditions.   Copings, corners, and projections shall not be cracked or injured during the removal of the forms. If damage occurs, the amount of concrete adjacent to the damaged portion shall be removed and replaced as directed with no additional 720\npayment.   The shape, strength, rigidity, water-tightness, and surface smoothness of re-used forms shall be maintained at all times. Any warped or bulged lumber shall be re-sized\nbefore being used. Unsatisfactory forms shall not be used. 725\n(h) Test Beams  When portland-pozzolan cement, types IP or IP-A, is incorporated into the\nstructural concrete elements listed below, when coal ash or slag cement is incorporated\ninto the structural concrete elements listed below, or when field operations are being 730\ncontrolled by beam tests, the removal of forms will be allowed when the modulus of rupture reaches or exceeds the following values:\nConcrete Use Required Flexural Strength, psi,\nDead Load Onl\ny\nGirders, Arches, and similar units 390\nInterior Bent or Pier Caps 480\nThe beams will be cured under the same conditions as the concrete which they 735\nrepresent. Beams will be tested for flexural strength as simple beams with third-point loading in accordance with 505.   702.14 Falsework and Centering  Detailed working drawings for falsework and arch centering shall be submitted in 740\naccordance with 105.02. Since the quality of the lumber is not known and because of\nthe uncertainty of computing nailed joints, no responsibility will be assumed by the\nDepartment for the strength of falsework and centering.   Working drawings for falsework shall include details for support of interior bent 745\ncaps, hammerhead piers, and the portion of the bridge floor and coping beyond fascia girders or beams if the overhang is 18 in. or more, or if a finishing machine, concrete spreader, or other equipment is to be supported by the overhang.  702.14\n641  The scheme of falsework for work on a span over active railroad tracks shall 750\nprovide a minimum horizontal clearance of 13 ft from the centerline of the nearest tangent track or 14 ft from the centerline of the nearest track on a horizontal curve and a minimum vertical clearance of 22 ft from the top of the highest track rail unless\ndifferent clearance values are approved by the railroad.\n755\n(a) Design and Construction\nFalsework shall be designed and constructed to safely carry the full load applied with a minimum settlement and deflection and with sufficient camber to counteract unavoidable shrinkage, deformation, and settlement. Structures shall have a permanent camber only when shown on the plans and the falsework shall be set to provide it. 760\nFor designing falsework and centering, a weight of 150 lb/cu ft shall be assumed\nfor plastic concrete. A live load allowance of 50 lb/sq ft shall be added for horizontal projections of surfaces. All beams supporting plastic concrete shall be designed so that there are no appreciable deflections under full load. The beams shall be considered as 765\nbeing unsupported by knee-bracing, such bracing to be considered as relieving sagging\nand bending only. The use of inclined columns, where properly braced, will be\nallowed.   The unsupported lengths of wooden columns and compression members shall not 770\nexceed 30 times the dimensions of the least side, or 30 times the least diameter.\n\nUnit stresses in timber shall not exceed the following:    For Douglas fir, white oak, long-leaf yellow pine: 775\nBending ....... 1,800 psi\nColumns ...... 1,800 (1-L/60D) psi\nFor spruce, cypress, short-leaf pine, white pine, western hemlock:\nBending ....... 1,500 psi 780\nColumns ...... 1,500 (1-L/60D) psi\nIn the above:\nL = length of column in inches    D = least diameter or least dimension in inches. 785\nHardwood wedges may be required to take up any settlement in the falsework, either before or during the placing of concrete.   Arch centering shall be constructed to enable it to be lowered or released gradually 790\nand uniformly after pouring arch ribs and rings. Lagging for arch centering shall be of\nuniform thickness. Unless otherwise specified, the nominal thickness shall be no less\nthan 2 in. A smooth surface shall be produced on the undersides of arch rings. The upper sides of all lagging shall be oiled before concrete is placed.  795\nUnless driving of piles for falsework bents is precluded by soil or other special 702.14\n642 conditions or unless otherwise specified, all bents for falsework shall have driven piles.\nThese shall be driven to support the required loads without settlement, spacing, and subsequent removal shall be satisfactory. If permission is given to place frame bents, they shall be placed on continuous concrete mudsills, or as approved. 800\n\n(b) Removal\nUnless otherwise specified, the following shall apply to the removal of falsework\nand centering:  805\n1. Falsework under a reinforced concrete slab top not supported\nby beams or girders shall remain in place at least seven days\nafter concrete placement and until attaining or exceeding 480 psi flexural strength. Operations on the slab may continue after achieving the required flexural strength. No additional 810\nconcrete shall be cast until the falsework has been released.\n2. Falsework under a bridge deck supported by beams or girders\nincluding the bridge deck overhang shall remain in place at least\nthree days after concrete placement and until attaining or 815\nexceeding 480 psi flexural strength. Falsework jacks may be loosened, but not removed, and operations may continue on overhangs three days after concrete placement and achieving the required flexural strength. Falsework jacks may be removed after seven days. 820\n3. Falsework for substructure concrete, such as interior bents and\npier caps, shall remain in place at least three days after concrete placement and until attaining or exceeding 480 psi flexural\nstrength. 825\n4. Falsework and arch centering under multiple-span arch bridges\nshall not be released from any one span until the adjacent and spandrel walls have cured for the required time and the next adjacent arch ring has been poured for at least 48 h. 830\n5. Falsework under continuously reinforced concrete slab and\ngirder units shall not be released from any span until the entire continuous unit has been completed and all concrete cured for the required period. 835\n\n6. For concrete poured during March, April, October, and\nNovember, or any time between April and October when the average temperature is less than 50\u00b0F, the above periods shall be increased 20%. For concrete poured during December, 840\nJanuary, and February, they shall be increased 40%.\n702.14\n643    7. Removal of supports shall be such that it enables the concrete\nto take the stresses, due to its own weight, uniformly and gradually. 845\n8. The removal of falsework shall be at the risk of the Contractor.\nPermission for removal may be refused if it is determined that\nthere may be resulting damage to the structure.\n850\n702.15 Joints    (a) Construction Joints\nConstruction joints shall be located across regions of low shearing stress and, so far as possible, where they are hidden from view in the finished structure. They shall 855\nbe made only where shown on the plans, unless otherwise specified.   Placing of concrete shall be continuous between construction joints. If placing is interrupted and a construction joint becomes necessary, provisions shall be made for\ninterlocking with the preceding layer by constructing raised keyways as shown on the 860\nplans or as directed.   When fresh concrete is intended to be joined to concrete that has already set, the surface of the in-place concrete shall be cut with a suitable tool to remove all loose and foreign material. The cut surface shall then be scrubbed with wire brooms and 865\nkept wet until the new concrete is placed thereon.    Immediately before the new concrete is placed, the forms shall be drawn tight against the in-place concrete and the exposed surface of the concrete shall be coated with a thin coating of mortar composed on one part cement and two parts No. 23 sand. 870\n\nAll concrete for slabs, beams, girders, cantilevered brackets, and footings shall be placed in one continuous operation to form monolithic construction. However, if, because of rain or other unavoidable reasons, concreting is interrupted where monolithic construction is required, the concrete shall be kept plastic by placing 875\nfrequent small batches until this part of the work is completed or until normal operations can be resumed. If the interruption is such that even partial operations cannot be carried on and construction joints are unavoidable, the joints shall be made in planes exactly normal to the main reinforcing bars and only where the shear is at a minimum. In simply supported slabs, beams, and girders, such regions of minimum 880\nshear are at or near the center of the span.\nUnless otherwise provided, pours in all abutments for an arch bridge shall be\ncontinuous from the top of footing to the skewback. If it is advisable to pour only a portion of the abutment at one time, a vertical construction joint may be placed parallel 885\nto the major reinforcement of the arch ring with written permission.   Horizontal construction joints will not be allowed in footings. If there is a 702.15\n644 probability that the entire amount of concrete cannot be poured monolithically, vertical\nor other construction joints shall be provided as directed. 890\nHorizontal construction joints in the shafts of reinforced piers, retaining walls, and abutments, other than abutments for arch bridges, may be made only if approved.\nWhere such joints show on an exposed surface, special care shall be taken to make the\njoints truly straight, clean, and watertight.  895\n\nTo avoid visible joints on exposed faces, the top surface of the concrete shall be\nfinished to the underside of a strip nailed to the form work for the exposed surface of the concrete, the strip to be placed as directed. If such a horizontal joint intersects any coping or any sloping surface where a featheredge would be formed, an inclined 900\nbulkhead shall be placed to make the joint normal to the sloping surface of no less than\n6 in. or, if there is a coping, no less than the depth of the coping. Horizontal construction joints will not be allowed in the stems of concrete T-beams or at the junction of T-beam stems and flanges.\n905\n(b) Expansion Joints\nBridge expansion joints shall be of the form, dimensions, material, and design\nshown on the plans. Open expansion joints shall be completely open for the\ndimensions specified and for their entire length. Preformed expansion joint filler shall be placed true and even and with abutting sections pressed together tightly. The 910\nmaterial shall be of the size shown on the plans and shall be in accordance with 906.03.\n(c) Folded Metal Joints\nThese joints shall be free from kinks and watertight. At bends, the strip shall be one piece if possible. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, the joints shall be soldered. 915\nCopper shall be in accordance with 910.16. Lead sheets shall be no less than 1/8 in. thick.\n(d) Sliding Joints\nThe surface of the supporting concrete for a sliding joint shall be troweled to a 920\nsmooth finish and then covered with the required thickness of bituminous material, or otherwise treated if so designated.    (e) Polychloroprene Joint Membrane  Polychloroprene joint membrane used for semi-integral end bents shall be secured 925\nto the concrete with an adhesive. The polychloroprene joint membrane shall be centered vertically on the joint and shall have no gaps. Any field joint in the\npolychloroprene membrane shall be lapped a minimum of 12 in.   702.16 Drainage Pipes Through Concrete Masonry 930\nAt all enclosures where water could not otherwise escape through the concrete,\ndrainage pipes shall be installed as shown on the plans. Before fill is placed around these pipes, geotextile for use with underdrains shall be placed over the drain pipe and securely held in place. Loose stone shall be laid by hand over the inlet end to provide a cover sufficient to retain the fill and enable free drainage.  935 702.16\n645\nDrains through abutments and retaining walls shall be placed with a slight incline downward towards the exposed face.   702.17 Encased Pipes and Conduits 940\nPipes and conduits to be encased in the concrete shall be installed before the\nconcrete is placed. No direct compensation will be made for the installation of the\npipes and conduits. No deduction in concrete quantities will be made for the volume occupied.  945\n702.18 Roadway Surface Drainage  Drainage grates and basins, necessary fittings, and connections to drainage pipes shall be placed as shown on the plans or as directed.   702.19 Pouring Bent Caps 950\nCaps shall not be poured on end bents or on any other bents falling within the limits of the approach grade until the fill material has been placed.\n\n702.20 Placing Concrete\n955\n(a) General Requirements\nConcrete shall not be placed until forms and reinforcing bars have been checked and approved. The forms shall be clean of all debris before concrete is placed. The method and sequence of placing concrete shall be approved.  960\nWhere concrete floor slabs are to be poured, walkways shall be provided to protect reinforcement from pedestrian traffic. Before placing concrete, continuous walkways shall be placed parallel to the section of floor to be poured and shall remain in place until after the concrete is placed and hardened sufficiently to avoid any damage.\nWalkways shall be constructed to not come in contact with the reinforcement and shall 965\nbe of sufficient width to allow finishing operations to be conducted entirely from the\nwalkway.   Except as otherwise directed, concrete shall be placed in horizontal layers of no\nmore than 24 in. thick. When less than a complete layer is placed in one operation, it 970\nshall be terminated by a vertical bulkhead. In order to avoid planes of separation between the layers and damage to the plastic concrete beneath, each layer shall be placed and consolidated before the preceding layer has taken initial set. On horizontal surfaces and at horizontal construction joints, the forms shall be overfilled approximately 1/2 in. and then struck off to the required elevation prior to the initial 975\nset of the concrete.\nWhen placing is temporarily discontinued and as soon as it becomes firm enough\nto retain its shape, the concrete shall be cleaned of all laitance and other objectionable material to a depth sufficient to expose sound concrete. Unless otherwise authorized, 980\ndepositing concrete shall not be discontinued within 18 in. of the top of a face. 702.17\n646 However, if provisions have been made for a coping of less than 18 in. thick, a\nconstruction joint may be made at the underside of the coping.   Where new concrete is to abut existing concrete, the existing concrete surfaces 985\nand existing exposed reinforcement shall be cleaned free of dust, chips, and water.\nEpoxy bonding resin adhesive, in accordance with 909.11, shall be used to coat the existing concrete surfaces. The epoxy coating shall be tacky at the time that the new concrete is placed. If the epoxy coating has cured beyond the obvious tacky condition, it shall be reapplied prior to placing the new concrete. 990\nAfter initial set of the concrete, the forms shall not be jarred and no strain shall be placed on the ends of projecting reinforcement.   The external surface of all concrete shall be worked thoroughly, during placing, 995\nby means of tools of an approved type. The working shall be such as to force all coarse aggregate from the surface and to bring mortar against the forms to produce a smooth finish substantially free from water and air pockets or honeycomb.\n\n(b) Chutes and Troughs 1000\nConcrete shall be placed to avoid segregation of the materials and the displacement of the reinforcement. Where steep slopes are required, the chutes shall be equipped with baffle boards or be in short lengths that reverse the direction of movement. Open troughs and chutes shall extend as nearly as possible to the point of deposit. Equipment made of or coated with aluminum alloys shall not be used to 1005\ntransport concrete. Pumping of concrete shall be in accordance with 702.10. When the discharge needs to be intermittent, a hopper or other device for regulating the discharge shall be provided. Placement of supplementary bins or hoppers may be ordered above the point where concrete is being deposited. The concrete shall be allowed to\naccumulate in these containers in considerable quantity and shall be discharged 1010\nimmediately through pipes extending from the bottoms of these bins or hoppers. All chutes, troughs, and pipes shall be kept clean and free from coatings of hardened concrete. The water used for flushing shall be discharged clear of the concrete already in place.\n1015\nConcrete shall not be dropped in the forms a distance of more than 5 ft except when confined by closed chutes or pipes. Each part of the form shall be filled by depositing the concrete as near final position as possible. The coarse aggregate shall be worked back from the forms and worked around the reinforcement without displacing the bars. After initial set of the concrete, the forms shall not be jarred and 1020\nno strain shall be placed on the ends of projecting reinforcement.\n\n(c) Vibrating  Unless otherwise directed, the concrete shall be compacted with mechanical vibrators operating within the concrete. When required, vibrating shall be 1025\nsupplemented by hand spading with suitable tools to ensure proper and adequate compaction.  702.20\n647\nVibrators shall be of an approved type and design, adequately powered and capable of transmitting 10,800 impulses per minute in air. The diameter of the head of 1030\nthe vibrator shall be 1 1/4 to 2 1/2 in. Vibrators shall be manipulated so that the concrete is thoroughly worked around the reinforcement and imbedded fixtures and\ninto corners and angles of the forms. Vibrators shall not be used as a means to cause\nconcrete to flow or run into position in lieu of placing. The vibration at any point shall be of sufficient duration to accomplish compaction but shall not be prolonged to the 1035\npoint where segregation occurs. Vibrators shall not be attached to or allowed to contact forms or reinforcement or to penetrate beyond any layer of fresh concrete.    (d) Depositing Concrete Under Water  No concrete except for foundation seals shall be deposited under water, without 1040\nwritten permission. If such permission is granted, care shall be exercised to prevent the formation of laitance. Concrete shall not be deposited until any laitance, which may have formed on concrete previously placed, has been removed. Pumping shall be discontinued while depositing foundation concrete if it results in a flow of water inside\nthe forms. If concrete, except for foundation seals, is deposited under water, the 1045\nproportion of cement used shall be increased at least 25% with no additional payment to compensate for losses due to water. Concrete deposited under water shall be placed in a compact mass in its final position by means of a tremie, a closed bottom dump bucket, or other approved method and shall not be disturbed after being deposited.  1050\nA tremie shall consist of a tube having a diameter of no less than 10 in. and\nconstructed in sections having flanged couplings fitted with gaskets. Support of the tremie shall be such that it enables free movement of the discharge end over the entire top surface of the area on which the concrete is to be deposited and allows rapid lowering, when necessary, to retard or stop the flow of the concrete. The discharge end 1055\nshall be kept closed until immediately prior to depositing in order to prevent water\nentering the tube and shall be completely sealed except when concrete is actually being deposited. The tremie tube shall be kept full to the bottom of the hopper. When a batch is dumped into the hopper, the flow of concrete through the tube shall be started by slightly raising the discharge end, but always keeping it in the previously deposited 1060\nconcrete. The flow shall be continuous until all the required concrete is deposited.    (e) Placing Footing Concrete  Except as otherwise provided for a foundation seal, footing concrete shall not be placed except when the cofferdam is dewatered and so maintained during placement. 1065\nIf it is necessary to operate the pump while placing footing concrete, or\nimmediately thereafter, the seepage water shall be conducted to a sump at the pump\nintake in such manner that it does not flow over the fresh concrete. Special care shall be taken to prevent pumping cement out of the fresh concrete. 1070\nFooting concrete may be placed directly against sheet piling of the cofferdam\nwhen shown on the plans or authorized in writing. Where Class X excavation has been 702.20\n648 extended beyond established neat lines of a footing, the bottom 12 in. of such footing\nshall be poured to the actual limits of the excavation. When necessary, the foundation 1075\nmaterial on which the footing is to rest shall be protected from freezing. Where an existing structure is to be extended, the existing footings shall be protected from damage. Damaged footings shall be repaired as directed with no additional payment.\n\nPiling, if any, shall be driven to or cut off at the proper elevation to enable 1080\nembedment in the footing concrete equal to that shown on the plans. All laitance or other unsatisfactory material shall be removed from the exposed surface of the concrete in place by some means which does not injure the concrete. If a footing is to be constructed on a foundation seal, it shall be to the dimensions shown on the plans and, if necessary, the height of the shaft adjusted to bring the bridge seat to the required 1085\nelevation.   Placing concrete in footings shall start at one end of the footing and be continued until the surface of the concrete is brought to the elevation of the top of the footing. The concrete shall be allowed to work forward, displacing any water with as little help 1090\nas possible. The concrete shall not be dragged through or shoveled into water or\ndeposited into running water. Placing concrete in more than a few inches of water shall be done only with written permission.    (f) Concrete Foundation Seal 1095\nA foundation seal may be required by the plans, as requested, or as directed. When required by the plans, the seal shall be constructed to the size shown, or as specified in writing. Where adverse dewatering conditions are encountered as described in 206.09, a foundation seal may be required to be placed to the necessary dimensions.\n1100\nIf a foundation seal is requested, written permission shall be obtained before\nstarting such work. If approval is given, the seal shall be placed to designated\ndimensions.\nSeals shall be of Class A concrete having a slump in accordance with 702.12, 1105\nplaced continuously from start to finish, and in accordance with 702.20(d). The cofferdam shall have been vented or ported at low-water level. The seal shall be of the thickness shown on the plans, or as requested and approved. When the seal has hardened sufficiently to withstand the hydrostatic pressure, the cofferdam shall be dewatered and the remainder of the structural concrete shall be placed in dry 1110\nconditions.   702.21 Finishing Concrete Surfaces\nUnless otherwise authorized, the surface of the concrete shall be finished\nimmediately after form removal. Only the minimum amount of covering necessary to 1115\nallow finishing operations to be carried on shall be removed at one time. Subject to approval, metal ties may be left in the concrete for the purpose of supporting or bracing subsequent work. Such ties shall be in accordance with 702.13(b) and shall be of a type which uses a cone and rod as both spreader and tie. Before final acceptance of the 702.21\n649 work, the cones shall be removed and the cavities filled, in accordance with 702.13(b). 1120\n\nAll concrete surfaces shall be given a finish immediately following the removal\nof any forms.   At the time of the removal of forms, the concrete surface shall be scraped to 1125\nremove all fins and irregular projections. The surface shall then be power ground to smooth all joints and chamfers.\n\nAfter grinding is completed, a paste of grout shall be applied to the concrete surface with a sponge float to fill all air holes and small irregularities. The paste grout 1130\nshall be six parts of pre-mix mortar mix for masonry and one part white portland\ncement in accordance with ASTM C150, Type I.   After the paste grout takes its initial set, the surface of the concrete shall be scraped with a steel drywall knife to remove the paste from the surface. 1135\nThe concrete surfaces of pier and bent caps, the front face of mudwalls, and any other concrete surfaces specified shall be sealed. The material used for sealing shall\nbe in accordance with 709. It shall be applied to obtain a finished film thickness of at\nleast 10 mils. Mixing, surface preparation, and method of application shall be in 1140\naccordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. However, the surfaces to be sealed shall be prepared in accordance with 709 prior to applying the sealer.   702.22 Curing Concrete  Concrete in bridge decks or the top surface of reinforced concrete slab bridges 1145\nshall be cured continuously 24 h per day for a minimum of 168 h commencing immediately after the surface is able to support the protective covering without deformation. Water curing in accordance with 702.22(a) shall be initiated within 60 minutes after the finishing machine completes the final strike-off of any portion of the\nconcrete surface. Curing or other protective efforts which may include the use of 1150\nevaporative retardants shall begin sooner if adverse conditions exist. Adverse conditions include, but are not limited to, high winds, extreme temperatures, or low\nhumidity. A work bridge shall be used following the finishing machine to facilitate the placement of curing materials, if necessary. Curing time for bridge decks and the top surface of reinforced concrete slab bridges are not controlled by beam tests and the 1155\ncure time shall not be reduced. In addition to the minimum of 168 h cure period, curing shall continue until a flexural strength of 550 psi has been attained. Curing of patches or small full depth deck replacement areas on existing bridge decks that are to be overlaid, may be controlled by test beams in accordance with 702.24(a).  1160\nUnless otherwise specified, all other concrete shall be cured continuously 24 h per\nday for at least 96 h commencing immediately after the surface is able to support the\nprotective covering without deformation. In addition to the required hours, curing shall continue until the flexural strength stated in 702.13(h) and 702.24 has been attained.\n1165\nWhere it has been determined that a surface treatment is to be used, the membrane 702.22\n650 forming curing compound shall not be used. Membrane forming curing compound\nshall not be used on bridge decks nor on reinforced concrete slab bridges.   The curing of surfaces to be waterproofed may be discontinued when 1170\nwaterproofing is started. If further precautions are necessary to ensure strength, they\nshall be taken as directed.\n(a) Water Curing Method\nSurfaces to be cured shall be protected and kept continuously and thoroughly wet 1175\nduring the curing period. Curing shall consist of pre-wetted burlap underneath a layer of white plastic sheeting with a network of soaker hoses. Other wet curing systems including engineered mats or blankets shall be submitted to the Engineer for approval at least 14 days prior to use. Burlap shall be free of contamination and shall be prepared by soaking in clean water for at least 2 h before beginning concrete placement. New 1180\nburlap shall be soaked at least 12 h prior to use. Immediately before use, the burlap shall be draped or suspended vertically to remove excess water that may dilute or damage plastic concrete. Soaker hoses shall be placed after the concrete is hard enough\nto walk on without deformation. The protective covering shall be suitably anchored to\nkeep the protective materials in place during the curing period. Curbs, walls, handrails, 1185\ncopings, and other surfaces requiring a finish in accordance with 702.21 may have the covering temporarily removed for finishing, but the covering shall be restored as soon as possible.    (b) Membrane Forming Curing Compound 1190\nAll surfaces shall be given the required surface finish prior to application of the curing compound. During the finishing period, the concrete shall be protected by the water curing method.\nThe curing compound shall be mixed thoroughly within 1 h before use. The 1195\napplication shall be a minimum spreading rate of 1 gal. of liquid coating for every 150 sq ft of concrete surface. Curing compound shall be applied to provide a uniform, solid, white opaque coverage on all surfaces, similar to a white sheet of paper. All concrete cured by this method shall receive two applications of the curing compound. The first application shall be applied immediately after stripping of forms and 1200\nacceptance of the concrete finish. If the surface is dry, the concrete shall be wetted with water and the curing compound applied just as the surface film of water disappears. The second application shall be applied after the first application has set. During curing operations all unsprayed surfaces shall be kept wet with water.  1205\nThe coating shall be protected against marring for at least 10 days after\napplication. All coatings marred or otherwise disturbed shall be given an additional\ncoating. If the surface coating is continuously subjected to injury, immediate application of water curing may be required. If the use of a curing compound results in a streaked or blotchy appearance, the method shall be stopped and water curing 1210\napplied until the cause of the defective appearance is corrected.  702.22\n651  702.23 Waterproofing\nThe expansion joint shall be waterproofed on the following:\n1215\n(a) the back surfaces of retaining walls,\n(b) the top surface of all slabs under fills,\n(c) the extrados of arches,\n(d) the inside faces of spandrel walls, and   (e) the abutments up to the finish grade line. 1220\n\nThe inside faces of spandrel walls and extrados of arches shall be waterproofed.   A firmly bonded membrane consisting of two layers of dry fabric and three\napplications of waterproofing material, shall be placed at all expansion joints set out 1225\nherein. One uncoated layer of fabric shall not touch another layer or the concrete at any point. There shall be at least three complete and separate applications of the\nwaterproofing material. The application shall be sufficiently heavy to conceal the weave in the fabric. Sufficient fabric shall be placed in V-strips at the joints to enable\nthe movement of adjacent sections of concrete without tearing the fabric. The 1230\nmembrane shall be carefully flashed at all exposed edges and laps sealed down thoroughly. Waterproofing shall be planned so that, at the close of work each day, all fabric placed shall have received the final application of waterproofing material.   Concrete surfaces to be waterproofed shall be reasonably smooth and free from 1235\nprojections and holes. Immediately before the application, the surface shall be cleaned of dust and loose materials. Waterproofing shall be done only when the surface is at least dry enough to prevent the formation of steam when the hot material is applied. When the air temperature is below 35\u00b0F, waterproofing shall not be done, unless otherwise specified. 1240\n\nThe material shall be applied to cover the area completely. If necessary, more than one coat shall be applied to secure a satisfactory coating and proper adhesion. Coating and fabric shall stop a uniform distance below the top surfaces of walls. The material shall not be splattered over surfaces or faces of concrete which subsequently are 1245\nexposed in the finished structure. Utility asphalt for waterproofing shall be heated to a temperature of between 300\u00b0F and 350\u00b0F. The material shall be stirred frequently to prevent local overheating. The waterproofing material shall not be damaged when backfill is placed against a waterproofed joint.  1250\n702.24 Application of Loads to and Acceptance of New Concrete\nExcept as otherwise hereinafter provided, application of loads to new concrete\nshall be in accordance with the following:\n\n(a) Equipment or traffic will not be allowed on structures until test 1255\nbeams representing all concrete required to carry live loads have attained a flexural strength of 550 psi for third-point loading.\n(b) Unbalanced backfill will not be allowed until test beams 702.23\n652 representing the concrete required to resist it have attained a 1260\nflexural strength of 440 psi for third-point loading. The\nunbalanced height shall not exceed 10 ft until test beams representing the concrete have attained a flexural strength of 480 psi for third-point loading.\n1265\n(c) The dead weight of steel or precast concrete superstructure shall\nnot be placed on concrete until test beams representing the concrete have attained a flexural strength of 400 psi for third-point loading. A dead load shall not be placed on hammer-head piers until test beams representing the concrete have attained a 1270\nflexural strength of at least 480 psi for third-point loading. The\nconcrete floor, if to be placed thereon, shall not be poured until test beams representing the concrete supporting the superstructure have attained a flexural strength of at least 440 psi for third-point loading. 1275\n\n(d) Test beams representing concrete anchoring inserts to support\nfalsework shall attain a flexural strength of a minimum of 480 psi for third-point loading, before a dead load of concrete is applied. 1280\n\n(e) When blended portland pozzolan cements, coal ash, or slag\ncement are used in bridge railings or concrete barrier and the temperature limitations in accordance with 702.05 are not met, the bridge railings or concrete barrier may be put into service 1285\nwhen flexural strength testing performed on test specimens indicate a modulus of rupture of 500 psi has been attained.\n\nNo time extension will be considered for delays due to time necessary to attain\nspecified strengths. 1290\nBeams will be prepared and tested in accordance with 702.13(h). Before traffic is allowed over a concrete structure built to be under fill, it shall be covered with 9 in. or more of earth or other suitable material, or otherwise protected. All other structures shall be properly protected against impact or other damage. 1295\nWhen compressive strength is used as a basis for acceptance of concrete, for determining when a latex modified concrete overlaid bridge deck may be opened to traffic, for determining form removal time, or for determining when a structure may be put into service, standard specimens shall be made and cured in accordance with 1300\nASTM C31 and shall be tested in accordance with ASTM C39. Strength requirements\nshall be in accordance with ASTM C94, with the exception that the strength shall be\nthe average of the strengths of all cylinders tested at the age specified, with a minimum of two cylinders. This average shall be equal to or greater than the required strength. If the compressive strength of one or more cylinders in a strength test is below 75% of 1305\nthe required strength, the entire test will be considered as failed. 702.24\n653\nFailure to meet the strength requirements will be cause for rejection of the quantity of concrete represented by the cylinders. All molds, facilities, and materials necessary to prepare and cure the specimens shall be furnished with no additional payment. 1310\n\n702.25 Field Drilled Holes in Concrete\nThis work shall consist of field drilling holes of the diameter and length shown on the plans or as directed.\n1315\nWhen vertical holes are to be drilled into the top of a concrete bridge deck, a minimum clearance of 2 in. shall be maintained between the bottoms of holes and bottom of slab. When vertical holes are to be drilled over a steel beam flange, the holes may be extended to the top of the beam flange. When vertical holes are to be drilled over a concrete I-beam, concrete box beam, concrete bulb-T beam, or concrete girder, 1320\nthe depths of the holes shall be as shown on the plans. If breakout occurs on the bottom of slab during the drilling process, the work shall be stopped, the breakout shall be repaired as directed, and an approved alternate drilling method shall be used to prevent breakout.  1325\nWhen grouted holes are specified, the diameter and length of the holes shall be in\naccordance with the grout manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.   702.26 Artificial Lighting  No portion of the work which cannot be finished during daylight hours shall be 1330\nstarted unless written permission is given, in which case adequate lighting shall be provided and maintained.   702.27 Method of Measurement  Concr ete w ill b e measur ed  by  th e cub ic y ard  in  accordan ce with the n eat lin es 1335\nshown on the plans or as directed. No deductions will be made for the volume of joint\nmaterial, embedded reinforcement, encased piles, or for a pipe with an area of less\nthan 1 sq ft.

Errors in the bar list and bending schedule will not\nbe cause for adjustment of the contract unit price.   703.04 Protection of Materials 25\nPlain and epoxy coated reinforcing bars shall be protected from damage during\nstorage, handling, installation, and concrete placement. Plain and epoxy coated reinforcing bars shall not be stored in direct contact with the ground. Epoxy coated reinforcing bars shall be protected from exposure to ultraviolet light and moisture during storage. Once placed into the work, epoxy coated reinforcing bars shall not be 30\nexposed to ultraviolet light for more than 21 days prior to placement of concrete. At\nthe time of concrete placement, reinforcing bars shall be free of dirt, loose rust or scale, grease, oil, or other foreign substance.    If the Engineer suspects the epoxy coating has been damaged by exposure to 35\nultraviolet light, a sample will be obtained and will be tested in accordance with 910.01(b)9.   Damage to the epoxy coating of epoxy coated reinforcing bars shall be repaired or the bars shall be replaced. Repairs to the epoxy coating shall be performed on all 40\ndamaged areas larger than 1/4 by 1/4 in. A bar will be rejected if the accumulated area\nof damaged coating exceeds 2% of the nominal surface area of the bar or if the total\narea of repaired coating exceeds 5% of the nominal surface area of the bar. All\ndamaged areas shall be cleaned and the repair shall be performed before visible\noxidation appears. Coating repair material shall be in accordance with 910.01(b)9. 45\n\nCONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS\n703.05 Bending  Reinforcing bars required to be bent shall be accurately cold bent in a bending 50\nmachine to the shapes shown on the plans. All bars in which cracks or splits occur at bends will be rejected.\n703.06 Placing and Fastening\n55\n(a) General Requirements\nReinforcing bars shall not be ordered for piers or bents to be founded on soil or rock until the foundation conditions have been investigated. The bottom elevations of such footings will then be determined. Written permission will then be given to order 703.06\n657 such reinforcing bars. Sufficient excavation and all necessary soundings shall be made 60\nas directed so that exact bottom elevations of footings may be determined.   All dimensions shown on the plans for spacing of reinforcing bars apply to centers of bars unless otherwise noted. All bars shall be accurately placed and, during placing\nof the concrete, held firmly in the position as shown on the plans. Distances from the 65\nforms shall be maintained by means of chairs, ties, hangers, or other approved support devices. All reinforcing bars shall be wired rigidly or fastened securely at sufficient\nintervals to hold the bars in place. Welding of reinforcing bars shall not be performed\nexcept as noted in 703.06(c). Epoxy coated reinforcing bars shall be tied with epoxy\ncoated or plastic coated tie wire. The upper layer and lower layer of reinforcing bars 70\nin RCBAs and bridge floors shall be tied or fastened at a minimum of every other intersection of the longitudinal and transverse bars to prevent an upward or a lateral\nmovement of a bar from the planned position.\nLayers of reinforcing bars shall be separated by support devices in accordance 75\nwith 910.01(b)11 or epoxy coated reinforcing bars. Epoxy coated reinforcing bars used\nto separate and support layers of reinforcing bars shall be shop bent to the dimensions\nrequired to secure the layers of reinforcing bars in the positions shown on the plans.\nThe size and spacing of support devices or epoxy coated reinforcing bars used as\nsupports shall be such that the plan reinforcing bars are not displaced by the weight of 80\nthe concrete, upper layers of reinforcing bars, or construction loads, but in no case\nshall the spacing exceed 4 ft in any direction.\nReinforcing bars shall be separated from horizontal surfaces by being suspended\nor supported on approved support devices capable of supporting the designed loads. 85\nSupports and spacers shall be of such shape as to be easily encased in concrete. That portion which is in contact with the forms shall be non-corrosive and non-staining\nmaterial. They shall be of an approved type. The use of pebbles, pieces of broken stone\nor bricks, metal pipe, wooden blocks, and similar devices for holding bars in position will not be allowed. 90\n\nAfter being placed, reinforcing bars will be inspected and approved before the\nconcrete is deposited. The positions of the reinforcing bars shall not be disturbed both during and after depositing the concrete. All concrete placed in violation of this requirement may be rejected and its removal will be required.

Max. 8.0%.\nProduction Tolerance[2]: \u00b11.5%\n[1] The selected target value shall be included in the concrete mix design.\n[2] Actual production shall not be below the min or above the max.\n2. Cold Weather Concrete 205\nCold weather concrete shall be in accordance with 702.11. 707.04\n676\n3. Hot Weather Concrete  When it is necessary to fabricate concrete structural members during times of hot weather the mix water may be chilled or an appropriate amount of ice may be added 210\nto the concrete mix in order to produce concrete of the temperature specified herein.\n\n4. Acceptance Testing  Acceptance of precast concrete and precast prestressed concrete structural\nmembers will be based on the following tests in accordance with the Frequency 215\nManual. All tests shall be performed in the presence of the Engineer. For conventional concrete slump, air content, and compressive strength tests shall be performed. For SCC slump flow, air content, relative viscosity, visual stability index, and compressive strength tests shall be performed.  220\nCompressive strengths of the structural members shall be determined from cylinder sets described herein. The 28-day compressive strength shall be equal to or greater than the specified concrete compressive strength. The compressive strength of\nthe concrete for each structural member will be determined from the average strength\nof the cylinder set representing that member. No individual strength within a cylinder 225\nset representing a structural member shall be less than 90% of the specified concrete compressive strength.   All molds, facilities, labor, and materials necessary to prepare, cure, and test the\ncylinder sets shall be furnished. 230\na. Cylinder Set\nA cylinder set shall consist of one cylinder from each set of tests taken in accordance with the Frequency Manual. The batches or loads to be sampled may be as\ndirected by the Engineer. All cylinders for acceptance shall be 6 in. diameter by 12 in. 235\nor 4 in. diameter by 8 in. molded and field cured in accordance with ASTM C31. The Contractor may make additional cylinder sets for use in acceptance testing. If 4 in.\ndiameter by 8 in. cylinders are used, cylinder strengths shall be multiplied by a\nreduction factor as follows:  240\nSTRENGTH REDUCTION FACTOR\nfor 4 in. diameter b\ny 8 in. c ylinders\nCylinder A ge Reduction Factor\n\u0094\u0003\u0017\u001b\u0003K  0.97\n> 48 h 0.94\n\nAll cylinders shall be identified by use of Department-marked cylinder\nidentification tags which are inserted a maximum of 3/8 in. into the top of each freshly molded cylinder. The cylinder number, a unique structural member identification number, temperature, air content, and slump of the concrete represented by each 245\ncylinder shall be referenced to the numbers on these cylinder identification tags and provided to the Engineer by the end of each day in which cylinders are cast. 707.04\n677\nCylinders shall be stored as near as possible to the point of deposit of the concrete represented. All surfaces of the cylinders shall be protected from the elements in the 250\nsame manner as the formed structural members. Cylinders shall be cured at the same temperature and moisture environment as the structural members.\n\nCylinders shall be in the moisture condition resulting from the selected curing treatment prior to testing. To meet these conditions, the cylinders shall be removed 255\nfrom the molds at the time the structural member is removed from the form work. Cylinders shall be tested in accordance with ASTM C39. The Contractor shall have on file a certificate of calibration for the testing machine. All cylinders in a cylinder set, for a given age, shall be broken within the time tolerances shown in ASTM C39. The Department will remove cylinder identification tags prior to the Contractor testing 260\nthe cylinders.\n\nb. Precast Concrete Structural Members  When fabricating precast concrete structural members which are not prestressed, the number of cylinder sets shall be cast in accordance with the Frequency Manual. 265\nThe 28-day compressive strength of the concrete for each structural member will be\ndetermined by the average strength of the cylinder set representing that member. The\nfabricator may elect to make additional cylinder sets for use in acceptance testing prior to 28 days.  270\nc. Precast Prestressed Concrete Structural Members  Cylinder sets shall be cast in accordance with the Frequency Manual. One cylinder set shall be tested and used to determine when the precast prestressed concrete structural member has met or exceeded the required strength for detensioning the prestressing bed. If an additional cylinder set as described above has been made, the 275\nContractor may test this set to determine if the required strength for detensioning of the prestressing bed has been met or exceeded, or if the required 28-day compressive\nstrength has been met or exceeded prior to an age of 28 days. The Engineer will accept\nthe results from the compression testing on the additional cylinder set, in place of either the detensioning strength test results, or the 28-day compressive strength test results, 280\nif the results equal or exceed the respective compressive strength requirements. If an additional cylinder set was not made, or if the additional cylinder set does not meet or exceed the 28-day compressive strength requirement, the remaining cylinder set shall be tested at 28 days of age to determine the acceptability of the structural members.  285\nCoring of precast prestressed concrete structural members shall not be performed. Precast prestressed concrete structural members that have been cored will not be\naccepted. Compressive strength results for cylinders that exceed 28 days in age or results from cylinders that do not have the Department-marked cylinder identification\ntag intact will result in the structural members not being accepted. 290\n(d) Other Requirements  Precast concrete structural members which are not prestressed shall have a minimum compressive strength of 4,500 psi in 28 days.  707.04\n678  295\nPrecast prestressed concrete structural members shall be in accordance with the following unless otherwise shown on the plans:     1. Maximum water/cementitious ratio in pounds of water per\npound of cementitious material shall be 0.420. 300\n2. Minimum 28-day compressive strength of concrete shall be\n5,000 psi.\n3. Minimum compressive strength of concrete at time of 305\nprestressing shall be 4,000 psi.\n\n4. Initial tension of prestressing strands shall be as shown on\nthe plans.\n310\nInspection of the precast prestressed concrete structural members during\nmanufacturing and checking and testing aggregates, cement, concrete, and steel specimens shall be performed. All specimens shall be furnished without cost to the\nDepartment. Inspection, checking, and testing performed by the Department will not\nrelieve the Contractor or the fabricator from performing their own QC inspection, 315\ntesting, and checking as necessary to maintain QC over the manufacturing, handling, and curing procedure.\nA permanent record of the force applied to, and measured elongation obtained for, each prestressing strand shall be provided. The record shall also identify the strand and 320\nstructural member to which the record applies. The accuracy of this record shall be certified by the fabricator\u2019s production supervisor that it accurately represents the force applied and measured elongation. The certified record shall be provided to the Engineer prior to shipment.\n325\n707.05 Forms  Structural members shall be manufactured in steel forms which are unyielding, smooth, mortar-tight, and of sufficient rigidity to prevent distortion due to pressure of the concrete. They shall be designed so the finished concrete is in accordance with the required dimensions and contours. The design of the forms shall account for the effect 330\nof vibration of the concrete as it is placed. Forms shall be chamfered in accordance with 702.13(a). Exposed edges of curbs shall be beveled or edged. Forms shall be set and maintained true to the lines designated until the concrete is sufficiently hardened or for periods hereinafter specified. Interiors of forms shall be treated with an approved form coating which allows them to be released without adhering, discoloring, or 335\notherwise damaging the concrete. Form coating materials shall not come in contact\nwith either reinforcing bars or prestressing strands.\n707.06 Placing and Finishing Concrete\nThe temperature of the prestressing strands and forms shall be monitored between 340\nthe time of the application of prestressing force and the placement of the concrete. 707.06\n679 During hot weather, approved means shall be undertaken to cool the forms\nimmediately prior to placement of the concrete.   Where prestressing strands are anchored to abutments that are independent from 345\nthe form, thermal adjustments shall be made if the temperature of the prestressing\nstrands at the time of tensioning differs by more than 25\u00b0F from the temperature of the\nconcrete mixture during placement. This requirement will not apply to self-stressing beds.  350\nVoid boxes, inserts, and attachments shall be securely fastened to maintain the proper position during concrete placement and consolidation. All voids shall have weep holes or otherwise be vented during beam production until after the initial concrete set, then sealed before the beams are shipped.  355\nDuring and immediately after depositing, concrete shall be consolidated with\nvibrators and suitable spading tools. Vibration shall be applied at the point of deposit and in the area of freshly deposited concrete. The vibrators used may be internal,\nexternal, or a combination of both. Internal vibration shall be of sufficient duration and\nintensity to consolidate thoroughly, but shall not be continued so as to cause 360\nsegregation. Vibration shall not be continued at any one point so that localized areas of grout are formed.   The entire operation of depositing and consolidating the concrete shall be conducted so the concrete will be smooth, dense, and free from any honeycomb or 365\npockets of segregated aggregates. The concrete in each structural member shall be placed in one continuous operation. The outside vertical faces of fascia structural\nmembers and the exposed face and top of the curb section, if applicable, shall be finished in accordance with 702.21.\n370\nThe vertical faces of top flanges on NEXT beams adjacent to closure pours shall\nhave an exposed aggregate finish to facilitate the bond between the beam and closure\npour concrete.\nThe tops of all beams and the outside faces and bottom flanges of the fascia beams 375\nshall be sealed in accordance with 709. The sealing requirement will be waived if the concrete meets the low permeability criteria specified in 707.04(c)1.\n\n707.07 Removal of Forms and Curing\nCuring shall be in an enclosure designed to minimize heat and moisture loss. 380\nInsulated blankets may be used. The concrete in the form shall be maintained at a minimum temperature of 50\u00b0F during the entire curing cycle. Curing for precast concrete or precast prestressed concrete structural members shall be done by wet\ncuring without supplemental heat or by accelerated curing. During the period of initial\nset of the structural member and during the accelerated curing by radiant heat, the 385\nconcrete shall be kept wet by the method outlined below for wet curing without supplemental heat.  707.07\n680  Prior approval shall be obtained for curing methods other than those outlined\nbelow. 390\nSide forms may be removed when no distortion, slump, or misalignment of the concrete will result. Precast concrete structural members which are not prestressed\nshall remain on the bottom supporting forms for the span until the concrete has reached\na strength of at least 2,000 psi as evidenced by cylinders sets made and cured in the 395\nsame manner as the slab.    (a) Wet Curing without Supplemental Heat  When wet curing without supplemental heat is used, the exposed surfaces of the structural members shall be covered by two layers of wet burlap and the burlap shall 400\nbe kept wet to ensure that free water is always present. In lieu of using wet burlap, the Contractor may propose an alternate method which provides a moist environment with free water being present at all times. Written approval from the Engineer will be required prior to use of the proposed alternat e method. Additional curing of precast\nconcrete or precast prestressed concrete structural members will not be required 405\nprovided the minimum specified ultimate strength can be obtained.\nIn precast prestressed concrete structural members, wet curing without supplemental heat shall continue until the compressive strength of the concrete reaches or exceeds the strength specified for transfer of prestress or detensioning. At this point 410\nwet curing is considered to have concluded. Detensioning shall be performed within 6 h after wet curing has concluded.    In precast concrete structural members which are not prestressed, wet curing\nwithout supplemental heat shall continue until such time as the compressive strength 415\nof the concrete reaches the strength specified for stripping of forms.\n\n(b) Accelerated Curing\nWhen accelerated curing of the concrete is used, it shall be done by low pressure steam or radiant heat curing. Radiant heat may be applied by means of pipes circulating 420\nsteam, hot oil, hot water, or by electric heating elements. When steam is used, the jets shall be positioned so that they do not discharge directly on the concrete, forms, or cylinders. The steam shall be at 100% relative humidity to prevent loss of moisture and to provide moisture for proper hydration of the cement.  425\nExcept to maintain a minimum concrete temperature of 50\u00b0F, heat shall not be applied until the concrete has attained initial set. The time of initial set may be determined by ASTM C403. Once the penetration resistance, as performed in\naccordance with ASTM C403, equals or exceeds 500 psi, accelerated curing may\nbegin. When the initial set is not determined by ASTM C403, the initial application of 430\nheat shall be a minimum of 4 h after final concrete placement. When retarders are used and the initial set is not determined by ASTM C403, this time shall be increased to a minimum of 6 h after final concrete placement. Heat shall always be applied at a controlled rate following the initial set of the concrete, and an effective method of 707.07\n681 retaining the heat and moisture in the concrete shall be used during the entire curing 435\ncycle.   During the initial application of radiant heat or live steam, the temperature measured in the concrete shall increase at an average rate not exceeding 36\u00b0F/h. The\nmaximum concrete temperature shall not exceed 158\u00b0F. A minimum of three time and 440\ntemperature recording devices, capable of recording temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit at intervals not exceeding 15 minutes, shall be provided throughout a contiguous form group and common heat source. The time and temperature recording devices shall be located at the portions of the contiguous form group likely to experience the maximum temperatures during curing. 445\nThe curing temperature shall be sustained until the concrete has reached the minimum required compressive strength for detensioning the structural members.\nOnce the concrete has achieved the required compressive strength, detensioning shall be performed while the concrete is still warm and moist. Detensioning operations shall 450\nnot interfere with the curing of the structural member.\n\nAs the application of heat is discontinued, the concrete temperature shall decrease at a rate not to exceed 50\u00b0F/h. When the concrete temperature has reached 40\u00b0F or less above the ambient temperature outside the curing enclosure, accelerated curing is 455\nconsidered to have concluded. A thermometer shall be provided to monitor ambient air temperatures. This thermometer does not have to have recording capabilities. The time and temperature recording devices shall be used to verify compliance with the heating and cooling rates contained herein.  460\nWhen multiple structural members are cast in the same bed, all members shall meet or exceed the specified release strength prior to detensioning. Additional curing\nof precast concrete or precast prestressed concrete structural members will not be\nrequired provided the minimum specified ultimate strength can be obtained.  465\nA grinder or other methods that induce minimal amounts of heat into the prestressing strand shall be used to cut off prestressing strands. The ends of the concrete structural member where prestressing strands have been cut to be flush with the end of the member shall be coated with bituminous mastic sealant in accordance with 907.11. All prestressing strands that are exposed and protrude from the end of the 470\nbeam shall be protected from rusting by use of a spray, brush, or roller-applied rust-inhibiting paint or other material that is not considered detrimental to bonding with concrete.\n707.08 Handling and Shipping 475\nPrecast concrete and precast prestressed concrete structural members shall not be subjected to excessive abuse which produces crushing or undue marring of the concrete. All structural members damaged during handling, storing, transporting, or erecting shall be replaced. Unless otherwise approved, precast concrete and precast\nprestressed concrete structural members shall be handled with a suitable hoisting 480 707.08\n682 device provided with a spreader sling. The spreader shall be of sufficient length to\nprevent horizontal forces being produced in the structural member due to lifting and\nshall be equipped with leads and hooks at each end. NEXT beams shall be handled in\na manner that minimizes twisting of the beams. NEXT beams shall be lifted by a\nminimum of four lifting points, two at each end of the beam, with a load equalizing 485\ndevice at one end of the beam that will prevent torsional forces in the beam during\nlifting. Unless otherwise shown on the contract plans, the location of the lifting points\nalong the tops of the beams shall be in accordance with the transportation support point requirements given herein. If any other method of handling is used, it shall be shown\nin the working drawings. If the method produces horizontal forces in the precast 490\nconcrete or precast prestressed concrete structural member, design calculations shall\nbe submitted showing resulting stresses. The design of the structural members shall be satisfactory to handle these stresses in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The structural members shall be lifted by the devices and procedures shown on the working drawings. 495\n\nThe structural members shall remain in an upright position at all times and shall\nbe supported as indicated herein when in storage and during transportation to the construction site.\n500\nIn storage, all structural members shall be fully supported across their width on\nbattens not less than 4 in. wide with one being placed at each end at the centerline of the bearing. The supports of the structural members while in storage shall be maintained in a level position so no twisting occurs.  505\nPrecast concrete structural members shall not be lifted, shipped, or used until the concrete compressive strength reaches a minimum of 4,500 psi for members which are not prestressed and 5,000 psi for members which are prestressed.   During transportation, the structural members shall be supported with truck 510\nbolsters or battens no less than 4 in. wide which are padded with no less than 1/2 in.\nof rubber. The ends of I-beams, U-beams, and bulb-tee shall extend no more than the\ndepth of the beam and not more than 3 ft 6 in. beyond the supports. The ends of box\nbeams and NEXT beams shall extend no more than 1 1/2 times their depth and not\nmore than 3 ft beyond the supports. The supports at one end of NEXT beams shall be 515\ndesigned to allow the transportation vehicle to twist about its longitudinal axis\nindependently from the beams, thereby eliminating the possibility of introducing\ntorsional forces in the beams during transportation. The ends of slabs shall extend no\nmore than the depth of the beam beyond the supports.   520\nSupports of cantilever beams shall be as shown on the plans. Trucks with double bolsters will be allowed, provided the beams are fully seated on the outer bolsters and\nthe inner bolsters are no more than 8 ft from the ends of the beams. Wood blocks or\nother suitable material shall be placed under the tie chains to prevent chipping the concrete. 525\n707.08\n683  707.09 Placing Structural Members\nIf the method of lifting the structural members in the field differs from the method shown on the beam fabrication working drawings, the Contractor shall submit working drawings and calculations in accordance with 707.08. Erection of precast prestressed 530\nconcrete structural members shall commence at the centerline and proceed out to the\ncurb, one member at a time. As each structural member is placed, the transverse tie\nbars, if shown on the plans, shall be inserted and secured. Any shifting of the structural members shall be done while they are held free of the supports by the hoisting device. The use of a steel pinch bar will not be allowed. Structural members shall be set to 535\nproper line and grade with uniform bearing on bridge seats, mortar joints, or bearing\npads as required on the plans. Prestressed box beams and NEXT beams that are\nsupported at two bearing locations on each end shall be shimmed as required to\nmaintain a maximum gap anywhere between the bottom of beam and bridge seat no\ngreater than 1/16 in. under the beam\u2019s own weight. The steel shims shall be in 540\naccordance with 915.04(b)2.\n\nWhen shown on the plans, prestressed box-beam members shall be secured to the\npier or bent with dowel rods. Holes for dowels shall be filled with mortar at fixed ends and with crack or joint filler at expansion ends. Longitudinal keyway joints shall be 545\ncleaned. A coat of cement mortar shall be scrubbed on the surface. The joint shall be\nfilled with a non-shrinking grout composed of 1 part portland cement, 2 parts No. 23 fine aggregate, and an approved non-shrinking additive or a non-shrink, non-metallic cementation grout in accordance with ASTM C1107. All bolts or drains shown on the plans as necessary or desirable to be placed in the concrete shall be placed by the 550\nmethods and at the locations shown on the plans. Necessary tie rods, tie bolts, and hardware for tying structural members together shall be furnished.   Dowel holes shall not be grouted nor concrete or the forming thereof, be placed in floor slabs, diaphragms, or shear keys prior to receipt of complete documentation 555\nof the acceptability of the structural members and bearing pads, including the\nsatisfactory laboratory reports and certifications in accordance with 915.04(f). Neither\nthe structural members, nor the bearings will be considered incorporated into the work,\nand neither will be paid for until this documentation is accomplished satisfactorily.  560\nRailing, when required, shall be of the type shown on the plans. The component parts shall be in accordance with 706, unless otherwise indicated on the plans. Other precast concrete or precast prestressed concrete structural members shall be placed in the structure in accordance with the plans and the specifications or special provisions indicated for the type of structure being built. 565\nCranes or other heavy erection equipment may be operated on the precast concrete\nor precast prestressed concrete structural members only if approved in writing and if\na proposed operating procedure is submitted showing loading, distribution of loads,\nresulting stresses, and that the design of the structural members is satisfactory to 570\nhandle these loads. However, such approval shall not relieve the Contractor of any damage from this operation.  707.09\n684  707.10 Blank\n575\n707.11 Method of Measurement  Precast concrete or precast prestressed concrete structural members will be\nmeasured by the linear foot.

    "text": "709.01 Description  This work shall consist of cleaning the concrete surface by sandblasting and applying a concrete sealer in accordance with 105.03. Surfaces to be sealed with PCC 5\nsealers shall be given a finish in accordance with 702.21. Where existing concrete or bridge decks are to be sealed, their surfaces shall be sandblasted to remove all foreign materials.\nMATERIALS 10\n\n709.02 Materials\nMaterials shall be in accordance with the following:    Non-Epoxy PCC Sealers ...................................... 909.10 15\n\nCONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS\n709.03 General Requirements  Concrete surfaces shall be 28 days or older prior to application. The concrete 20\nsurface shall be allowed to dry at least 48 h immediately prior to sealing. Sealer shall\nbe applied only when the concrete surface, sealer, and ambient temperatures are all\nbetween 40\u00b0F and 100\u00b0F. The sealer shall be applied at the manufacturer\u2019s specified application rate and shall not exceed the maximum rate stated on the QPL of Non-Epoxy Portland Cement Concrete Sealers. Spray applications shall be 25\naccomplished using low pressure, non-atomizing spray equipment adjusted to the wet spray condition, approximately 15 psi. The sealer shall be applied to vertical surfaces such that the spray pattern will be 6 to 8 in. wide and all surfaces shall achieve a uniform coverage. Horizontal surfaces shall be completely flooded.   30\nThe sealer shall not be applied when wind conditions may cause overspray. Sealer shall not be applied in rain or when rain is expected to occur within 2 h after completing the sealing application.\n\n709.04 Surface Preparation 35\nThe surface to be sealed shall be thoroughly cleaned of all foreign materials by sandblasting if the surface is a bridge deck or older existing concrete, or by air blasting for all other surfaces, just prior to sealing. The air compressor shall be equipped with suitable separators, traps, or filters which remove water, oil, grease, or other 709.04\n689 substances from the air lines. If sufficient rain occurs to uniformly wet the surface after 40\nthe cleaning operations and prior to the sealing, the surface to be sealed shall be re-sandblasted or re-airblasted.\nThe concrete to be sealed shall be cured as stated on the QPL of Non-Epoxy\nPortland Cement Concrete Sealers prior to sealer application. 45\n709.05 Sealer Application  The concrete surface to be sealed shall be completely cleaned and shall be dry and dust free prior to the application of concrete sealer. The concrete sealer shall be applied in a crisscross pattern and should any flat or dry spots appear, more sealer shall be 50\napplied. However, there shall be no puddling of material on the surface. The sealed surface shall be allowed to cure in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. No vehicular traffic will be allowed on the sealed surface during the curing time.  55\nA qualified technical representative of the manufacturer may be required to be on\nthe job the first day the sealer is used. It shall be this representative\u2019s responsibility to\ninstruct the workers in proper mixing, application technique, and safety precautions.    (a) Non-Epoxy PCC Sealers 60\nThe sealer selected for use shall be applied at the application rate specified on the QPL of Non-Epoxy Portland Cement Concrete Sealers. The sealer shall be applied\nwithout dilution or alteration. Sealers which are applied by spraying shall be sprayed onto the concrete surface using low pressure spray equipment with a sufficient number of passes to achieve the minimum application rate and a uniform coverage. The 65\nlow-pressure spray apparatus shall have a 15 psi maximum nozzle pressure with a course fan spray, such as a garden, form oil, horticulture, or other low pressure sprayer.\nThe spray equipment tanks and hoses shall be thoroughly clean, free of foreign matter,\noil, residue, and water prior to use. Sealers shall be selected from the QPL of Non-\nEpoxy Portland Cement Concrete Sealers and shall be spread to achieve uniform 70\ncoverage. If roller spreading is required, a clean new roller shall be used for each application sequence. If brooming is specified, a clean, stiff-bristled broom shall be used to spread and work the sealer into the concrete surface.    ( b )  C l e a r  S e a l e r s  75\nClear sealers shall be used on all vertical wall surfaces including, but not limited to concrete bridge railing, barrier wall, and exterior concrete bridge beams when\nsealing is specified for these items. Clear sealers will be those identified on the QPL of Non-Epoxy Portland Cement Concrete Sealers.\n80\n(c) Alternate to Concrete Sealers\nIn lieu of concrete surface sealing for concrete barrier wall, terminal joint lugs, pier and bent caps, bridge railing, and bridge railing transitions, an alternate concrete\nmix design may be used.\n85\nThe concrete mix design shall be as specified, except either 3% silica fume by 709.05\n690 weight of cementitious material shall be added to the mix design or 30% slag cement\nsubstitution based on the required cement content shall be incorporated into the mix. The substitution of slag cement shall be in accordance with 702.05. A water-reducing admixture or a water-reducing retarding admixture shall be used in the mix design, 90\nand the amount of water added shall be adjusted accordingly.

Any drifting required shall only be for drawing the parts into position but not 960\nsufficient to enlarge the holes or distort the metal. Unfair holes shall be reamed or drilled.\nAll field splices are optional, except as shown on the plans. Splice elevations have\nbeen calculated to include structural steel dead load only, with falsework removed. 965\nThe tops of beam or girder splice plates shall be adjusted to the splice elevations shown on the plans before bolting field splices.   Splices shall be set to grade with the steel unsupported by falsework and prior to\nfinal bolting. After bolting is complete, these elevations shall be surveyed and 970\nsubmitted to the Engineer for review and concurrence. Adjustment shall be made as\ndirected if steel elevations are not within allowable tolerances. Forms used for concrete\ndeck slabs shall not be set to final elevation until all structural steel within the\ncontinuous superstructure unit being formed has been erected to proper grade.\n975\n711.61 Misfits\nThe correction of minor misfits involving harmless amounts of reaming, cutting, and chipping will be considered a legitimate part of the erection. However, any error in the shop fabrication or deformation resulting from handling and transportation which prevents the proper assembling and fitting up of parts by the moderate use of 980\ndrift pins or by a moderate amount of reaming and slight chipping or cutting shall be reported immediately and approval of the method of correction shall be obtained.   The correction shall be made in the presence of the inspector. If the contract provides for complete fabrication and erection, the Contractor shall be responsible for 985\nall misfits, errors, and injuries and shall make the necessary corrections and\nreplacements. If the contract is for erection only, the inspector, with the cooperation\nof the Contractor, shall keep a correct record of labor and materials used. Within 30 days, an itemized bill shall be presented for approval.  990\n711.62 Pin Connections  Pilot and driving nuts shall be used in driving pins. They shall be furnished 711.61\n716 without charge. Pins shall be driven so that the members take full bearing on them. Pin\nnuts shall be screwed up tight and the threads burred at the face of the nut with a pointed tool. 995\n711.63 Blank\n\n711.64 Diaphragm Connections\nDiaphragm connections other than those shown on the plans may be allowed. If 1000\nother connections are proposed, details shall be submitted for approval. The Contractor shall assume full responsibility for layout of all diaphragm connections and for the\naccuracy of all fitted parts. Connections will not be allowed which require field\nwelding to the web, except at supports.  1005\n711.65 Bolted Connections Using High Strength Bolts    (a) General\nThis subsection covers the assembly of structural joints using ASTM F3125,\ngrades A325, A490, and F1852 high strength bolts installed to develop the minimum 1010\nrequired bolt tension specified in 711.65(d)1. The bolts are to be used in holes provided\nin accordance with 711.21, 711.22, and 711.23.\nHigh strength bolts shall be 7/8 in. in diameter unless noted.  1015\n(b) Bolts, Nuts, and Washers\nBolts, nuts, and washers shall be of the grade shown on the plans and in\naccordance with 910.02(g). Grades A490 or F1852 may be furnished, at no additional\ncost to the Department, when grade A325 is shown on the plans. All galvanized nuts shall be lubricated with lubricant containing a visible dye. Black bolts shall be oily to 1020\nthe touch when installed. Weathered or rusted bolts shall be cleaned and lubricated\nprior to installation.    (c) Bolted Parts\nThe slope of surfaces of bolted parts in contact with the bolt head and nut shall 1025\nnot exceed 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis. Bolted parts shall fit together solidly when assembled and shall not be separated by gaskets or any other interposed compressible material.    When assembled, all joint surfaces, including those adjacent to the bolt heads, 1030\nnuts, or washers, shall be free of scale, except tight mill scale surfaces shall also be\nfree of dirt, loose scale, burrs, other foreign material, and other defects that would\nprevent solid seating of the parts.\nContact surfaces within slip-critical joints shall be free of oil, grease, and any 1035\nother material that reduces friction between the contact surfaces. Faying surfaces shall\nbe coated in accordance with 619.11(a).\n711.65\n717   (d) Installation\n1040\n1. Bolt Tension  When all fasteners in the joint are tightened, each shall provide at least the\nminimum bolt tension shown in Table A for the size and grade of fastener used.\n\nTABLE A 1045\nMinimum Bolt Tension for ASTM F3125 Bolts, lb\nBolt Size, in. Grades A325 and F1852 Grade A490\n1/2 12,000 15,000\n5/8 19,000 24,000\n3/4 28,000 35,000\n7/8 39,000 49,000\n1 51,000 64,000\n1 1/8 64,000 80,000\n1 1/4 81,000 102,000\n1 3/8 97,000 121,000\n1 1/2 118,000 148,000\n* Equal to 70% of the min. tensile stren gth given in ASTM F3125\n\nThreaded bolts shall be tightened with properly calibrated wrenches or by the turn-of-nut method. If required because of bolt entering and wrench operation clearances, tightening by either procedure may be done by turning the bolt while the nut is prevented from rotating. Impact wrenches, if used, shall be of adequate capacity 1050\nand sufficiently supplied with air to perform the required tightening of each bolt in approximately 10 s.\nThe installation of all high strength bolts shall be in accordance with AASHTO\nLRFD Bridge Construction Specifications. Any Grade A325 or A490 bolted 1055\nassemblies that accumulate rust or dirt prior to assembly shall be cleaned, relubricated,\nand two fasteners from each lot shall be tested for rotational capacity in accordance\nwith ASTM F3125. Any Grade F1852 bolted assemblies that accumulate rust, dirt, or\nhave their factory applied lubrication compromised shall be discarded. Grade A325,\nType 3 bolts may be reused once if the nut can be run down the entire threaded length 1060\nof the bolt by hand. No other grade or type of high strength bolts shall be reused after\nbeing fully tensioned. The snug-tight condition as defined in AASHTO LRFD Bridge\nConstruction Specifications shall be obtained prior to final tightening by all tightening\nmethods listed herein. The snug-tight condition is typically achieved with a few\nimpacts of an impact wrench, application of an electric torque wrench until the wrench 1065\nbegins to slow, or the full effort of a worker with a spud wrench.\nA Skidmore-Wilhelm calibrator or other acceptable bolt tension indicating\ndevices shall be provided on the project site for use during bolt installation. 711.65\n718 Verification tests shall be performed prior to the start of work, and at the frequency 1070\nspecified for each method of tensioning, to ensure the installed bolt, nut, and washer\nassembly develops the required tension.\n2. Washers\nAll fasteners shall have a hardened washer under the nut or bolt head turned in 1075\ntightening, under both the head and nut when Grade A490 bolts are used for steel with\nyield less than 40 ksi, and at all oversize or slotted holes. Where an outer face of the\nbolted parts has a slope of more than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis, a smooth beveled washer shall be used to compensate for the lack of parallelism.  1080\n3. Calibrated Wrench Tightening  If calibrated wrenches are used to provide the bolt tension specified in 711.65(d)1,\nthe settings shall induce a bolt tension of 5% to 10% in excess of this value. Tightening\nshall only be performed by turning the nut of the assembly when the calibrated wrench\nmethod is used. These wrenches shall be calibrated at least once each working day by 1085\ntightening, in a device capable of indicating actual bolt tension, no less than three\ntypical bolts of each diameter from the bolts to be installed. Verification testing shall\nalso be performed when the lot of any bolted component is changed, when any\ncomponent of the bolted assembly is relubricated, when any component of the wrench\nincluding hose or air supply is altered, or as directed by the Engineer. Power wrenches 1090\nshall be adjusted to stall or cut-out at the selected tension. If manual torque wrenches are used, the torque indication corresponding to the calibrating tension shall be noted and used in the installation of all bolts of the tested lot. Nuts shall be in tightening motion when torque is measured. When using calibrated wrenches to install several bolts in a single joint, the wrench shall be turned to touch up bolts previously tightened 1095\nwhich may have been loosened by the tightening of subsequent bolts. This shall be continued until all are tightened to the required amount.\n\n4. Turn-of-Nut Tightening\nVerification testing shall be performed on a representative sample of not less than 1100\nthree typical bolts of each diameter prior to the start of work, and as directed by the\nEngineer. Each bolted assembly shall be tested in a bolt tension measuring device, and\nin accordance with the measuring device manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. After\nbringing the assembly to a snug-tight condition, the nut and protruding end of the bolt\nshall be match-marked to visually inspect the nut rotation during the test. The nut shall 1105\nthen be tightened by the applicable amount of nut rotation specified in Table B, and\nthe resulting bolt tension, as measured by the tension measuring device, shall be\nrecorded. The resulting bolt tension shall be equal to or greater than the verification\ntension in Table C.\n1110\nAfter all bolts in the connection have been tightened to a snug-tight condition, the\nnut and protruding end of each bolt shall be match-marked to allow for visual\ninspection at the completion of tensioning. All bolts in the joint shall then be tightened\nadditionally by the applicable amount of nut rotation specified in Table B with tightening progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free 1115 711.65\n719 edges. During this operation there shall be no rotation of the part not turned by the\nwrench.\nTABLE B\nNut Rotation(1)(2) from Snug-Tight Condition\nBolt length\nmeasured from underside\nof head to end of bolt(3) Geometry of Outer Faces of Bolted Parts\nBoth faces normal\nto bolt axis One face normal\nto bolt axis and other\nface sloped not more\nthan 1:20(4) Both faces sloped\nnot more than 1:20\nfrom normal to bolt\naxis(4)\nUp to and including 4\ndiameters 1/3 turn 1/2 turn 2/3 turn\nOver 4 diameters, but not\nexceedin g 8 diameters 1/2 turn 2/3 turn 5/6 turn\nOver 8 diameters, but not\nexceedin g 12 diameters 2/3 turn 5/6 turn 1 turn\n(1) Nut rotation is rotation relative to bolt regardless of the element (nut or bolt) being turned.\nTolerance on rotation: 1/6 of a turn over and nothing under.\n(2) Applicable only to joints in which all material within the grip is steel.\n(3) When the bolt length exceeds 12d b, the required nut rotation shall be determined by actual\ntesting in a suitable bolt tension measurement device.\n(4) Bevel washer not used.\n1120\nTABLE C\nVerification Bolt Tension for ASTM F3125, Grade A325 Bolts, lb\nBolt Size, in.

Twist-Off Tension Control Bolt Method\nVerification testing shall be performed on a representative sample of not less than\nthree typical bolts of each diameter prior to the start of work, and as directed by the 1125\nEngineer. The bolted assemblies shall be tested in the condition they will be used\nduring erection and shall not be cleaned or relubricated prior to testing. After the bolted\nassembly has been installed in the tension measuring device and brought to a 711.65\n720 snug-tight condition using the installation tool, the spline shall be inspected to verify\nthat it hasn\u2019t been severed. The installation tool shall then be used to complete 1130\ntensioning and severe the splined end from the bolt. The final tension as measured by\nthe tension measuring device shall not be less than that specified in 711.65(d)4 Table\nC. If any bolted assemblies develop lower tension than specified, the cause of the\ndeficiency shall be determined and resolved prior to retesting. Any modifications or\ncorrections to the bolted assemblies, such as relubrication, shall only be performed by 1135\nthe bolt manufacturer.\n\nAll bolts in the connection shall initially be brought to the snug-tight condition\nwithout severing the spline at the end of the bolt. Any bolt that has the spline severed\nduring the snug-tightening operation shall be removed at replaced prior to final 1140\ntensioning. The final tensioning shall be performed with the installation tool,\nprogressing systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges.\n(e) Inspection\n1145\n1. It will be determined that requirements 2 and 3 of 711.65(e) are\nmet in the work. When the calibrated wrench method of tightening is used, the Engineer shall be given full opportunity to witness the calibration tests prescribed in 711.65(d)3.\n1150\n2. The installation and tightening of bolts will be observed to\ndetermine that the selected tightening procedure is properly used and that all bolts are tightened.\n3. The following inspection shall be used unless a more extensive 1155\nor different inspection procedure is specified.\n\na. An inspection wrench which may be either a torque\nwrench or a power wrench that can be adjusted accurately in accordance with 711.65(d)3 shall be used. 1160\nb. Three bolts of the same grade, size, and condition as\nthose under inspection shall be placed individually in a calibration device capable of indicating bolt tension.\nThe length may be any length representative of bolts 1165\nused in the structure. There shall be a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt.\n\nc. When the inspecting wrench is a torque wrench, each\nbolt specified in requirement 3b of 711.65(e) shall be 1170\ntightened in the calibration device by any convenient means to the minimum tension specified for its size in 711.65(d)1. The inspecting wrench shall then be applied to the tightened bolt. The torque necessary to 711.65\n721 turn the nut or head 5\u00b0, or approximately 1 in. at a  1175\n12 in. radius, in the tightening direction shall be determined. The average torque measured in the tests of three bolts shall be taken as the job inspecting torque to be used in the manner specified in requirement 3e of\n711.65(e). 1180\nd. When the inspecting wrench is a power wrench, it shall\nbe adjusted so that it shall tighten each bolt specified in requirement 3b of 711.65(e) to a tension at least 5% but no more than 10% greater than the minimum tension 1185\nspecified for its size in 711.65(d)1. This wrench setting shall be taken as the job inspecting torque to be used in the manner specified in requirement 3e of 711.65(e).\ne. Bolts represented by the sample prescribed in 1190\nrequirement 3b of 711.65(e) which have been tightened\nin the structure shall be inspected by applying, in the\ntightening direction, the inspection wrench and its job inspecting torque to 10% of the bolts, but no less than two bolts, selected at random in each connection. If no 1195\nnut or bolt head is turned by this application of the job inspecting torque, the connection shall be accepted as properly tightened. If a nut or bolt head is turned by the application of the job inspecting torque, this torque shall be applied to all bolts in the connection. All bolts 1200\nwhose nut or head is turned by the job inspection torque shall be tightened and reinspected, or alternatively, the\nfabricator or erector may opt to retighten all bolts in the\nconnection and then resubmit the connection for the specified inspection. 1205\n711.66 Bolted Connections Using Other Than High Strength Bolts  Bolts for these connections shall be in accordance with 910.02(h).   711.67 Final Clean-Up 1210\nFinal clean-up shall be conducted in accordance with 104.07.\n711.68 Structural Steel Cutting, Rivet and Bolt Removal, and Drilled Bolt Holes in Repair Projects\nField cutting of structural steel shall be done as shown on the plans or as directed. 1215\nFlame cutting in the field shall not be performed unless approved by the Engineer.\nApproval will be based on a review of the Contractor\u2019s proposed flame cutting\nmethods, which shall include written descriptions of the specific methods to be used\nand measures to be taken to ensure there are no heat affected zones or rough edges on\nload carrying structural components that are to remain in place. 1220 711.66\n722\nRivets or bolts connecting steel at locations shown on the plans or as directed shall be removed. This work shall be done in a manner that does not damage the surrounding\nsteel. If necessary, such work shall be accomplished by drilling.  1225\nBolt holes shall be drilled as directed in the field. A bolt hole is a hole required\nfor one bolt drilled through any number and thicknesses of metal plates.\n711.69 Jacking an d Supporting Beams\nWhen jacking and supporting a beam is required on a bridge repair project, 1230\nworking drawings and calculations, in accordance with 105.02 for jacking and\nsupporting shall be submitted for approval. This work shall not be performed until the\nworking drawings are approved.\n711.70 Field Cleaning and Storage of Weathering Steel 1235\nCleaning of structural steel specified to be left unpainted shall be in accordance with 619.08(a), or 619.08(c), or as determined by the Engineer, depending on the\nseverity of the soilage. Foreign matter which adheres to the steel after it has been\nblasted and which inhibits formation of the oxide film shall be removed as soon as practical. The use of acids to remove scale and stains will not be allowed. Storage shall 1240\nbe such to enable free drainage to avoid moisture pockets.\n711.71 Coating\nAfter erection is complete, the structure shall be coated unless otherwise provided.\nCoating shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of 619. 1245\n711.72 Method of Measurement  Structural steel shapes, fabricated steel, steel castings, iron castings, bolts, pins,\nrollers, rockers, anchor bolts, and threaded rods will be measured by the pound. If the\nSchedule of Pay Items includes a lump sum item for structural steel, all materials listed 1250\nabove shall be included in the pay item. No measurement will be made.   Stud shear connectors placed on new structural steel will not be measured. Stud shear connectors placed on existing structural steel will be measured by the number installed. 1255\nBronze plates will be measured by the pound. Pay weight will be based on a theoretical density of 536 lb/cu ft. Volume will be computed based on finished\ndimensions. No deductions will be made for drilled holes.  1260\nField cutting of structural steel will be measured by the square inch as determined\nby the multiplication of the length times the depth of the cut. Removal of rivets and removal of bolts will be measured by the number of each removed. Drilled holes for bolts on repair work will be measured by the number of drilled holes.\n1265\nJacking and supporting structural members will not be measured for payment.\n711.72\n723  Peening will be measured by the linear inch of peened weld. The length of weld\npeened will be measured once per weld regardless of the number of passes necessary to complete the work as specified. 1270\nRepair welds will be measured by the linear inch of repaired weld.\n\n711.73 Basis of Payment  The accepted quantities of structural steel shapes, fabricated steel, steel castings, 1275\niron castings, bolts, pins, rollers, rockers, anchor bolts, and threaded rods will be paid for at a contract lump sum price if the Schedule of Pay Items includes a lump sum pay item for structural steel. Changes from the estimated quantities shall be in accordance with 711.73(a).  1280\nIf the Schedule of Pay Items does not include a lump sum pay item for structural steel, the accepted quantities of structural steel will be paid for at the contract unit price per pound for structural steel. Such pay item will include all work listed above, complete in place. Payment will be in accordance with 711.73(b).\n1285\nStud shear connectors placed on existing structural steel will be paid for at the contract unit price per each, complete in place and accepted.   The accepted quantities of bronze plates will be paid for at the contract unit price per pound.  1290\nThe accepted quantities of field structural steel cutting will be paid for at the contract unit price per square inch for structural steel, field cut.    The accepted quantities of rivet removal, bolt removal, and drilled holes will be 1295\npaid for at the contract unit price per each for rivet, remove; per each for bolt, remove;\nand per each for drilled hole.   Jacking and supporting structural members, if specified as a pay item, will be paid for at the contract lump sum price for jacking and supporting the types of structural 1300\nmembers shown in the Schedule of Pay Items.   The accepted quantities of peened weld will be paid for at the contract unit price per inch. The accepted quantities of repaired weld will be paid for at the contract unit price per inch. 1305\nBolts, including anchor bolts and threaded rods, will be paid for as the full weight\ncomputed on the basis of 490 lb/cu ft, including nuts and washers, for the actual\nnumber of bolts in the structure.  1310\nIf welding is shown on the plans, the weights of the structural steel parts will be computed as described above.  711.73\n724  The weight of castings will be computed on the basis of 490 lb/cu ft for cast steel,\nand 450 lb/cu ft for cast iron, based on the net volume of the finished castings as shown 1315\non the plans, including fillets at angles. No deductions will be made for holes required to be drilled in castings or for rounding the corners of castings.\n(a) Lump Sum Basis\nAn estimated weight of structural steel will be shown on the plans. Such weight 1320\nwill be computed by the same method as that used when computing the estimated weight when paid for on a unit price per pound basis from semi-detailed plans. This weight will include all structural steel and miscellaneous metals unless otherwise included in specific pay items.  1325\nThe weight of structural steel shown on the plans is approximate only. For a lump sum pay unit, the Contractor shall determine the weight on which the bid is based. If there is a discrepancy between the plan weight and the actual weight, no decrease or increase in the payment for the work will be made on account of such discrepancy.  1330\nIf a change in the plans is made which will affect the weight of material to be\nfurnished, payment for the addition or reduction of structural steel quantities required as a result of such change in plans will be made at a unit price per pound obtained by dividing the lump sum amount for structural steel by the total estimated weight of structural steel shown on the plans. Such unit price may be adjusted in consideration 1335\nof the fabricating and connection cost. Changes in the plans involving classifications of structural steel may increase the pay quantities. Such additional quantities will be paid for on comparison of evidence of invoice prices.    (b) Unit Weight Basis 1340\nThe weight of materials will be shown in the bill of materials on the plans when\nthis information is included in such plans, or as computed from the fabricator\u2019s\napproved working drawings when this information is not included in the plans. In\neither case, such weight shall include all changes ordered.  1345\nFor rolled sections, the gross weight of the steel will be considered. The weight will be figured on the basis of 490 lb/cu ft. The weight of each piece will be the weight of the smallest regular shape from which the detail piece can be cut, not deducting cuts or holes. When so shown on the contract plans or on the approved working drawings,\nthe weight of groups of two or more pieces shall be the weight of the smallest regular 1350\nshape from which the given group of detail pieces may be cut by properly arranging the cuts.\nPayment will be made under:\n1355\nPay Item Pay Unit Symbol\nBolt, Remove ....................................................................

Water flow shall be readily adjustable to compensate 445\nfor minor variations in aggregate moisture content and shall be displayed by an\napproved flow meter. The flow of the latex modifier shall also be displayed by an approved flow meter. The manufacturer\u2019s inspection plate shall clearly show the serial number, proper operating revolutions per minute, and the approximate number of counts on the cement meter to deliver 94 lb of cement. 450\nThe mixer shall automatically proportion and blend simultaneously all the ingredients of the specified mix on a continuous or intermittent basis as required by the finishing operation. The latex modified concrete shall be discharged through a conventional chute directly in front of the finishing machine. The surface ahead of the 455\ndeposited mixture shall be kept damp by spraying it with water. Where the water is applied by the mixer, it shall be dispensed ahead of the water flow meter.\n\n(b) Silica Fume Modified Concrete\nMixing shall be in accordance with 702.09(a), 702.09(b), and 702.09(c), except 460\nmixing time shall be a minimum of 84 s. Retempering SFMC by adding water or by other means will not be allowed after 30 minutes from initial batching and mixing. When concrete is delivered in transit mixers, additional water may be allowed to 722.09\n793 increase a marginally low slump. Water shall not be added once 10% of the load has\nbeen discharged. Additional mixing shall be performed as directed and all operations 465\ncompleted within the time limits in accordance with 702.09(c). The amount of water shall be determined accurately and noted on the batch ticket. Such addition of water will not be allowed as a continuing operation. The total of all water included in the\nmix shall not exceed the maximum allowable water/cement ratio.\n470\n722.10 Placing and Finishing  Existing expansion joints shall be maintained throughout the overlayment unless\notherwise shown on the plans. A construction dam or bulkhead, equal in thickness to the joint width, shall be installed to the required grade and profile prior to placing the overlay. Screed rails for the finishing machine shall be placed to the required profile 475\nand anchored for stability both vertically and horizontally. Screed rails shall not be\ntreated with a bond breaking compound.   The overlay shall be placed only when the ambient temperature is 45\u00b0F and rising, unless otherwise approved by the Department in writing. The maximum allowable 480\nambient temperature during placement is 85\u00b0F. The overlay shall not be placed if rain\nis expected within 4 h. Adequate precautions shall be taken to protect freshly placed\noverlay concrete from sudden or unexpected rain. Damaged material shall be removed\nand replaced with no additional payment. A construction dam or bulkhead shall be installed in case of a delay in placement of 1 h or more. During delays of less than 1 h, 485\nthe end of the placed overlay concrete shall be protected from drying with layers of\nwet burlap.   After the surface has been cleaned, and immediately before placing the overlay\nconcrete, the surface shall be thoroughly soaked and covered with plastic sheeting for 490\na period of 1 h. The surface shall not be allowed to dry before placing the overlay\nconcrete and there shall be no standing water at the time of placement. The surface\nshall then be thoroughly and evenly coated with a brush applied bond coat of overlay concrete, except a bond coat shall not be applied to surfaces where the removal was performed by hydrodemolition. The progress of the bond coat application shall be 495\ncontrolled to ensure that the bond coat does not dry before the overlay is placed to the required grade. Aggregate segregated in the brush application of the bond coat shall be removed before the overlay is placed. Surface irregularities shall be filled to approximately three-quarters of their depth sufficiently ahead of the overlay operation to allow the material to stiffen and resist rolling back during the finishing. 500\nFollowing the bond coat application and partial filling of any surface irregularities, the concrete overlay shall be placed to an elevation approximately 1/2 in.\nabove final grade. The mix shall then be consolidated and machine finished to the\nrequired grade. The machine finishing shall be to within 12 in. of the curb line or 505\ncoping line unless otherwise directed. Supplemental hand finishing with a wood float shall be performed as needed to produce the required tight and uniform surface.\nThe finishing machine shall be self-propelled and capable of positively controlled 722.10\n794 forward and reverse motion. The machine shall be equipped with at least two finishing 510\ndevices. The first finishing device shall be a vibrating mechanism, such as a vibrating pan, for consolidating the deposited mix. The vibrating pan shall be metal and of sufficient dimensions to ensure proper consolidation. The second finishing device shall be either a rotating cylindrical drum, at least 45 in. in length, or a vibrating\noscillating metal faced screed of 4 in. minimum in width. The vertical position of the 515\nfinishing devices shall be positively controlled and the devices shall be raised clear of the finished surface when the machine is operated in the reverse direction. The vibration frequency of any vibrating finishing device shall be variable, with positive control between 3,000 and 6,000 vibrations per minute. Alternate finishing machines may be considered for approval subject to a written request. 520\nScreed rails and construction dams shall be separated from the newly finished overlay by passing a pointing trowel along the rail-to-overlay and dam-to-overlay interfaces after the overlay has sufficiently set such that it does not flow back. This trowel cut shall be made for the entire length and depth of the rail or dam. The rails 525\nmay be removed any time after the overlay has initially set. Adequate precautions shall\nbe taken during and after the rail removal to protect the edge of the new overlay from\ndamage.   Protection shall be provided to prevent rapid drying of concrete. The rate of water 530\nevaporation shall be determined both prior to placement based on forecasted conditions and during placement based on actual conditions in accordance with ACI 308, section 5.2.1 or the following equation:\nE = (T\nc2.5 - rT a2.5)(1 + 0.4V) x 10-6 535\nwhere:\nE = Evaporation rate, lb/sq ft/h\nT\nc = Concrete mix temperature, \u00b0F\nTa = Ambient temperature, \u00b0F\nr = (Percent of Relative Humidit y)/100\nV = Wind velocit y, mph.\n\nMeasurement of T a, r, and V shall be obtained from readings made by the local\nweather bureau or the Contractor's measurements made on site. Measurement of T c 540\nshall be determined from the concrete on site at the point of placement. Fog misting shall be performed after the finishing operation and prior to the wet cure, where the evaporation rate exceeds or is expected to exceed 0.05 lb/sq ft/h. Fog misting shall keep the environment above the concrete surface at high humidity to protect against\nplastic shrinkage cracks and shall not be used to apply water directly to the surface to 545\nfacilitate finishing. Evaporation retardants shall not be substituted for fog misting where the evaporation rate exceeds 0.05 lb/sq ft/h.\nAn evaporation retardant shall be applied in a fine mist immediately after the finishing is complete to ensure that the surface remains wet until covered. The 550 722.10\n795 evaporation retardant shall be used as such and not as a finishing aid. These products\nconsist primarily of water and excessive amounts of evaporation retardant shall not be applied and the product shall not be worked into the overlay surface. Evaporation retardant shall only be used on SFMC overlays. Evaporation retardant shall not be used in any other applications. 555\n\n722.11 Texturing  The overlay surface shall be textured with a double thickness burlap drag or a minimum 4 ft wide turf drag immediately following the placement of the overlay\nconcrete. Areas where the texture is disturbed by other finishing operations shall be 560\nimmediately restored to a burlap drag finish.   Grooving or tining in the plastic concrete of the concrete overlay will not be allowed. Longitudinal grooving shall not commence until the curing requirements\nhave been met in accordance with 722.12. Grooves shall be cut into the hardened 565\nconcrete surfaces parallel to the centerline using a mechanical cutting device. For curved bridges, grooves shall be cut along the curve chord within the spans. Grooving\nshall be done before traffic is allowed on the surface except as follows.\nThe Contractor shall have the option of cutting the longitudinal grooves at the end 570\nof each phase of construction or waiting until all phases have been completed. If the Contractor elects to delay the grooving process until completion of all phases, the concrete overlay surface for any phase opened to traffic shall receive an interim coarse broom finish during placement.  575\nThe completion of the grooving process shall be within 30 days of completion of the last phase of construction. Any additional maintenance of traffic operations required for the grooving process shall be included in the cost of Maintaining Traffic.\nThe interim broom finish shall not be allowed as a surface texture when opened to\ntraffic over a winter season. If the coarse broom texture is present and the Contractor 580\nis not in a position to finish all phases of the project, longitudinal grooving shall be placed into the hardened concrete in order to establish an acceptable driving surface texture for the winter season.   Each groove shall be 1/8 in. \u00b11/64 in. in width, 3/16 in. \u00b11/16 in. in depth. The 585\ngrooves shall be uniformly spaced at 3/4 in. intervals measured from the center of groove to center of groove. Grooving shall not be within the area approximately 2 ft adjacent to the curbs or railings. The grooving shall not be cut closer than 3 in. nor\nfurther than 6 in. from any construction joint running parallel to the grooving. The grooving shall not be cut within 6 in. of deck drains, curbs, or expansion joints. If the 590\nbridge has a variable width traffic lane, the grooving shall remain parallel to the\ncenterline of the main roadway. Any staggering of the groove terminations to accommodate the variable width shall be within the shoulders. Stair stepped ends in grooving will be allowed for skewed bridge decks. When a new reinforced concrete approach slab is placed adjacent to the overlay, the grooving shall extend across the 595 722.11\n796 reinforced concrete approach slab. Grooving shall terminate approximately 6 in. from\nthe interface with the roadway pavement.   The grooving machine shall contain diamond blades mounted on a multi-blade arbor on a self-propelled machine built for grooving hardened concrete surfaces. The 600\ngrooving machine shall have a depth control device that detects variations in the deck\nsurface and adjusts the cutting head height to maintain a specified depth of the grooves. The grooving machine shall have a guide device to control multi-pass alignment.   The Contractor shall submit a wastewater control and disposal plan for approval 605\nseven days prior to commencing grooving activities. The wastewater control and disposal plan shall detail how all wastewater generated by the grooving activities shall be contained, tested for pH, stored and transported to a disposal facility in accordance with 202.  610\nCleaning of the grooving debris and slurry shall be performed with a vacuum system equipped with fugitive dust control devices and be capable of removing wet\ndebris and water in the same pass. The vacuum equipment shall be capable of washing\nthe deck with pressurized water during the vacuum operation to dislodge all debris and slurry from the bridge deck surface. Debris and slurry shall not be allowed to dry prior 615\nto vacuuming.   722.12 Curing\nWhen coal ash is used, the requirement for additional wet or dry curing time shall be determined based on the relative initial, and final time of set and a comparison of 620\nstrength versus age using control concrete strengths at conventional cure period ages as the reference. The additional curing requirements shall be as approved by the\nEngineer.\n\nFor LMC overlays the minimum curing period shall be 48 h of wet cure followed 625\nby 48 h of dry cure. An LMC overlaid bridge deck may be opened to traffic during the dry curing duration when the compressive strength of cylinders is 4,000 psi or greater.   For SFMC overlays the minimum curing period shall be seven calendar days consisting of 120 h of wet cure followed by 48 h dry cure. The deck shall remain 630\ncompletely covered during the dry cure period. An SFMC overlaid bridge deck may be opened to traffic after the dry cure period when the compressive strength of cylinders is 4,500 psi or greater.   For LMC-VE concrete overlays the minimum curing period shall be 3 h of wet 635\ncure. An LMC-VE overlaid bridge deck may be opened to traffic after the wet curing\nperiod when the compressive strength of cylinders is a minimum of 2,500 psi.   The wet cure period for all overlay types is not controlled by strength and shall not be reduced. Membrane forming curing compound shall not be used to cure the 640\nbridge deck overlay. All cylinders shall be 6 in. by 12 in. and compressive strength 722.12\n797 shall be determined from the average of a minimum of two cylinders. For LMC and\nSFMC, cylinders shall be cast and cure d in accordance with 702.24. For LMC-VE\ncylinders shall be cast and field cured at the jobsite under the same conditions as the LMC-VE overlay. 645\n\nThe plastic film which forms on the surface of the overlay shall be protected from\nshrinkage cracking with a single layer of well drained wet burlap. This layer of wet burlap shall be placed as soon as the overlay surface will support it without deformation. The entire surface shall be covered with plastic sheeting and maintained 650\nin a saturated wet condition during the wet cure period. A network of soaker hoses shall be used under the plastic sheeting during the wet cure period for LMC and silica fume overlays.   When the ambient temperature falls below 50\u00b0F during either the wet or dry 655\ncuring periods, the time that the temperature is below 50\u00b0F shall not be considered as part of the total curing period. When there is sufficient rain to wet the surface of the\noverlay for 1 h or more during the dry cure period, this number of hours shall not be\nconsidered as part of the dry cure period.\n660\nImmediately upon the start of the dry cure period or opening to traffic, the surface shall be checked for cracks. Upon request, the Contractor shall flood the deck with water to facilitate inspection for cracks and distress. Where cracks exist, a thorough investigation will be conducted prior to sealing cracks. Cores may be required to determine the actual crack depth. Surface cracks not exceeding 3/8 in. in depth shall 665\nbe sealed with a PCC Sealer/Healer followed by an application of an approved sand.\nCracks exceeding 3/8 in. in depth shall not be sealed at this time. Corrective procedures for repairing cracks exceeding 3/8 in. in depth will be determined after further investigation which may include additional cores. The Department\u2019s Division of\nMaterials and Tests will be contacted and the Engineer will determine the method of 670\nrepair including possible removal.\nWhere the area of shallow cracking exceeds 5% of the deck area, then the method of repair shall be the same as for cracks exceeding 3/8 in. The shallow crack area will be calculated by multiplying the total combined linear feet of all cracks less than 3/8 in. 675\ndeep by a tributary width of 1 lft. The percentage of deck area will be the shallow crack area divided by the total deck area and multiplied by 100.   Where it is determined by sounding or coring that adequate bonding between the\noverlay and the bridge deck has not been attained, the deficient areas shall be removed 680\nand replaced as directed.\n\n722.13 Calibration of Continuous Mixers    (a) Frequency 685\nA complete calibration shall be performed for each mixer prior to each pour unless the initial calibration was made within the previous 10 calendar days.

Where deformed liner pipe is shown on the plans, the pipe structure shall\nbe lined with solid wall HDPE liner pipe or profile wall HDPE liner pipe.\n35\nThe maximum number of joints and corresponding maximum length of each section of liner pipe used in each pipe structure to be lined shall be as shown on the plans. If the Contractor has obtained the necessary right-of-entry from all affected property owners and all necessary new permits or amendments to existing permits to enable work in areas accessible via Contractor-obtained right-of-entry, the Department 40\nwill consider a written request by the Contractor to use liner pipe sections which exceed the maximum length shown on the plans. A corresponding reduction in the maximum allowable number of joints shall be included with the written proposal. The Contractor shall not install longer sections of liner pipe until written approval has been received from the Engineer. 45\n\nThe liner pipe shall either be selected from those shown on the QPL of Thermoplastic Pipe and Liner Pipe Sources or shall be accompanied by a certification in accordance with 907.25 and 916. If the liner pipe is not on the QPL of Thermoplastic Pipe and Liner Pipe Sources, then the certification shall be furnished. Liner pipe shall 50\nbe submitted to the Engineer for review and approval prior to installation.\nProper care shall be taken to ensure that no damage is done to the liner pipe during the unloading process. All liner pipes shall be unloaded with straps and lifting equipment. 55\n\nLiner pipe joints shall be bell and spigot, screw type, grooved press-on, butt fused,\nextrusion welded, or other joint as recommended by the liner pipe manufacturer and shall be installed according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended methods.  60\nWhere a deformed HDPE liner pipe is specified, the liner pipe shall be made deformed by using equipment specifically designed to take a circular liner pipe and deform it without causing damage to the liner pipe. The equipment and method used to deform the liner pipe shall be described in the QCP.   65\nOnce the liner pipe has been deformed, it shall be structurally reinforced in the horizontal and vertical planes. Structural reinforcement shall be spaced at a maximum distance of 3 ft on centers. Structural reinforcement shall not be removed until the\ninstallation of the liner pipe and cellular concrete grout at that structure has been\ncompleted. 70 725.02\n824\n725.03 Right-of-Entry Areas\nIf the Contractor desires more working room than the right-of-way provides, the\nContractor may elect to pursue rights-of-entry from all necessary adjacent property owners in accordance with 107.14. A temporary fence shall be installed as required to 75\nprevent encroachment of the public or livestock into the work area. Upon completion\nof the work, disturbed areas on private property shall be restored in accordance with 107.14.   725.04 Quality Control 80\nA QCP shall be submitted in accordance with ITM 803. No work on the pipe\nlining operation shall begin until written notice has been received that the QCP has been accepted by the Engineer. Acceptance of the QCP in no way relieves the Contractor of the responsibility for installation procedures and testing requirements.  85\nA QC representative shall be present at the jobsite for the initial testing of the first welding or fusing at each liner pipe installation location and for the joining, welding,\nor fusing of the liner pipe at each location.\n725.05 Filling of Cavities Outside of the Existing Pipe 90\nAll obvious cavities outside the existing pipe shall be filled with non-removable flowable backfill in accordance with 213 prior to the liner pipe installation or with cellular concrete grout placed in conjunction with the grouting operation after the liner pipe is installed.  95\n725.06 Joining Liner Pipe  Each liner pipe joint shall be welded, fused, or joined according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended methods. Welded liner pipe joints shall be welded with\na continuous weld for the circumference of the liner pipe both inside and outside.\nWelded liner pipe joints shall have weld beads that are smooth and shall not project 100\nfurther than 3/8 in. into the inside of the liner pipe and shall not reduce the hydraulic capacity of the liner pipe. The ends of liner pipe that are to be welded or butt fused shall be at the same temperature \u00b15\u00ba F.   A visual inspection will be conducted for acceptance of all liner pipe joined by 105\nmethods other than by welding or fusing joints. All joints that do not pass visual inspection shall be removed, shall have a new joint fabricated, and will be re-inspected.   All liner pipe joints shall have sufficient mechanical strength to withstand the liner pipe installation and cellular concrete grouting operations. 110\n\n(a) Welder, Butt Fuser, or Joiner Joint Testing\nWelding, butt fusing, or joining shall be performed by an operator trained and certified by either the manufacturer of the liner pipe or the manufacturer of the welding, butt fusing, or joining equipment. A copy of the operator\u2019s certification shall 115\nbe provided to the Engineer prior to the start of work. Prior to fabricating a production 725.06\n825 joint on a liner pipe, each operator who is performing welding, butt fusing, or joining,\nshall demonstrate that they can produce a joint that will withstand a destructive test prior to being allowed to join liner pipe. This test shall be repeated as many times as necessary to produce a joint that will pass the destructive test. One passing joint test is 120\nrequired per operator per contract. The method of joint testing shall be in accordance\nwith section (b) or (c) below.\n(b) Solid Wall HDPE Liner Pipe\nSolid Wall HDPE liner pipe joined using butt fusion shall be in accordance with 125\nASTM F2620.   Solid wall HDPE liner pipe that is to have extrusion welded joints shall have destructive testing performed on a test section of liner pipe of the same material as the liner pipe being installed. The Contractor shall propose and describe in the QCP a 130\ndestructive test, such as but not limited to a bend strap test, to demonstrate that an operator can produce an extrusion welded joint that will not fail. Once an extrusion welded joint is produced on a test section that passes the destructive test, each\nsubsequent joint fabricated that same day by that operator will be visually inspected\nfor acceptance. A destructive test in accordance with the QCP shall be conducted on 135\nthe test section at the beginning of each day that solid wall HDPE liner pipe joining is being done.    (c) Profile Wall HDPE Liner Pipe  Profile Wall HDPE liner pipe joined using extrusion welding shall be in 140\naccordance with ASTM F894. The Contractor shall propose and describe in the QCP a destructive test, such as but not limited to a bend strap test, to demonstrate that an operator can produce an extrusion welded joint that will not fail. Destructive testing shall be performed on two flat pieces of HDPE sheet stock that has been butt welded\ntogether to verify the extrusion gun is working properly and that the operator can 145\nproduce an extrusion welded joint that will not fail. Once an extrusion welded joint is produced on a test section that passes the destructive test, each subsequent joint fabricated that same day by that operator will be visually inspected for acceptance. A destructive test in accordance with the QCP shall be conducted on the test section at\nthe beginning of each day that profile wall HDPE liner pipe joining is being performed. 150\n725.07 Cellular Concrete Grout  The cellular concrete grout shall be designed in accordance with ASTM C869 except as herein modified.  155\nThe admixtures, retarders, and plasticizers used in the grout shall be in accordance\nwith the foam concentrate supplier\u2019s specifications.\nThe grout shall be made using the preformed foam process using foam generating equipment calibrated daily by the foam manufacturer to produce a precise and 160\npredictable volume of foam. The foam concentrate shall be certified by the 725.07\n826 manufacturer to have specific liquid/foam expansion ratio at a constant dilution ratio\nwith water.\n\nThe specific job mix shall be submitted to the Engineer by either the foam 165\nconcentrate supplier or the certified or licensed grouting contractor for approval prior to use on the contract. The mix shall have a minimum 28-day compressive strength of 150 psi. The mix shall be tested by a laboratory qualified by the Department or shall be approved based on prior acceptable performance on Department contracts.\n170\nThe cellular concrete grout pump gauges shall be calibrated a minimum of once per month in the presence of the Engineer by the method described in the QCP.   Grout mixed off site shall be delivered to the job site in a truck mixer in accordance with 702.09 filled to half its capacity. The foaming agent shall then be 175\nadded to the cement mix in the truck and mixed to a uniform consistency.   Grout mixed on site shall be batched in a deck mate or similar device. Small batches of approximately 1 cu yd shall be mixed and pumped in a continuous operation. 180\n\nFor each day worked or for each 100 cu yds placed, four test cylinders measuring\n3 in. by 6 in. shall be cast at the point of placement of the grout. Sampling, molding, curing, and compressive strength testing of the cylinders shall be in accordance with ASTM C495, except as modified herein. 185\n\nInitial curing period shall be at a temperature of 70\u00b0F r10\u00b0F and shall be from\ntwo to five days. After the initial curing, the test specimens shall be placed in a moist\ncloset or moist room or stored in an enclosed curing tank above the water level. All specimens shall be kept in their molds in the moist storage for the remainder of the 190\ncuring period. The specimens shall be tested at 28 days. At that time, the specimens shall be prepared for testing in accordance with ASTM C495, except the bearing\nsurface may be ground or cut with a dry saw to meet surface tolerance. The specimens\nshall not be capped. Specimens shall be tested in compression as rapidly as possible\nto minimize drying. If more than one specimen is removed from the moist storage at 195\nthe same time, these specimens shall be covered with a damp cloth until time of testing. A Type A certification in accordance with 916 shall be provided for cellular concrete grout. The result of the compressive strength test shall be shown on the certification for cellular concrete grout.  200\n725.08 Liner Pipe Installation  Prior to commencing the liner pipe installation, all jagged existing pipe edges or other deformities shall be repaired. All debris and foreign material shall be removed from the existing pipe and disposed of in accordance with 203.08. A visual walk-\nthrough inspection shall be performed after all debris and foreign material has been 205\nremoved from the existing pipe to assess the current condition of the pipe. If visual inspection is not possible, a video inspection of the existing pipe shall be performed. 725.08\n827 A copy of the video inspection shall be provided to the Engineer. If, upon completion\nof the inspection of the existing pipe, the Contractor believes that they cannot proceed with the work as shown on the plans, the Engineer shall be notified. 210\nThe cross-sectional area of the liner pipe shall be as shown on the plans.\n\nPrior to commencing the liner pipe installation operation, steps shall be taken to verify that a liner pipe meeting the required cross-sectional area can be successfully 215\nplaced inside the existing pipe. If it is discovered prior to installation that a liner pipe with the required opening area cannot fit, the inside and outside diameters of a substitute liner pipe shall be submitted to the Engineer for  approval. If this discovery\nis not made until after the liner pipe installation has begun, the partially installed liner pipe shall be removed. Inside and outside diameters for a substitute liner pipe shall 220\nthen be submitted to the Engineer for approval.   After the liner pipe installation is complete and the liner pipe has cooled to the temperature of the existing pipe, the liner pipe shall be cut so that each end is 8 in.\noutside the end of the existing pipe. 225\nThe cellular concrete grout within the annular space between the existing pipe and the liner pipe shall be contained by bulkheads. The bulkheads shall be constructed at each end of the structure. Each bulkhead shall be constructed to withstand the pressure of the grouting operation. The bulkhead shall be free from leaks and the exterior 230\nsurface shall be given a smooth trowel finish. The bulkhead shall extend from the end of the existing pipe inward a minimum depth of 18 in.   Cellular concrete grout shall be injected into the annular space between the existing pipe and the liner pipe. The injection operation shall provide sufficient cellular 235\nconcrete grout to fill all voids between the existing pipe and the liner pipe over the\nentire structure length, but shall also be performed in a manner that does not distort the liner pipe. Injection of the cellular concrete grout in lifts, use of spacers, or other safeguards shall be taken to keep the liner pipe in position and prevent the liner pipe from floating. The pressure developed in the annular space between the liner pipe and 240\nthe existing pipe shall not exceed the liner pipe manufacturer\u2019s recommended maximum value.   All existing culverts, storm drains, underdrain pipes, drain tile, or other pipes that are directly connected to the lined structure shall be perpetuated. Cellular concrete 245\ngrout shall not leak through the liner pipe at these connections.\n725.09 Method of Measurement\nAll thermoplastic liner pipe will be measured by the linear foot, for the shape and cross-sectional area of the liner pipe, complete in place. Perpetuation of existing pipes 250\nthrough the liner pipe will be measured by the number of existing pipes perpetuated.   No measurement will be made of liner pipe joints or the length of joint welding 725.09\n828 or fusing, or other incidentals necessary to join sections of liner pipe in accordance\nwith the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The liner pipe or flat sheet stock used for 255\ndestructive testing will not be measured for payment. No measurement will be made of a liner pipe meeting the required opening area that does not fit.\nNo measurement will be made for debris removal and disposal, filling existing\nvoids, or trimming, cutting, jacking, or other corrective measures performed on jagged 260\nedges or other deformities of the existing pipe to facilitate installation of the liner pipe. No measurement will be made for visual or video inspection of the existing pipe.   No measurement will be made for the bulkhead.  265\n725.10 Basis of Payment  The accepted quantities of thermoplastic liner pipe will be paid for at the contract unit price per linear foot for the shape and cross-sectional area of the liner pipe, complete in place. Perpetuation of existing pipes through the liner pipe will be paid for by the number of existing pipes perpetuated. 270\n\nPayment will be made under:    Pay Item Pay Unit Symbol  275\nLiner Pipe, Thermoplastic, Circular, _______sq ft ..............

For internal stability design purposes, the design height, H\nD, of wall shall be as follows:\n\n1. For a wall with a level surcharge, the design height of the 130\nwall, H D, shall be measured from the theoretical top of the\nleveling pad to the top of the coping or to the gutter line of the traffic barrier. The top of the wall shall be the theoretical top of the face panels only where a coping or\nbarrier is not used. 135\n731.03\n843    2. For a wall with a sloping surcharge, the design height of\nthe wall, H D, shall be measured from the theoretical top of\nthe leveling pad to a point above the top of the wall as calculated from the formula as follows: 140\n\nHD = H + 0.3H tan\u0215\n1- 0.3 tan\u0215\n\nwhere:\n\u0215\u0003 \u0003VXUFKDUJH\u0003VORSH\u0003DQJOH\u0003DV\u0003PHDVXUHG\u0003IURP  145\nthe top of the coping, and\nH = height of the wall from the theoretical\ntop of the leveling pad to the top of the coping.\n\n3.

If the Contractor elects to use the same size coarse aggregate in both the reinforced and retained backfill zones, geotextiles Type 2B in accordance with 918.02(a) shall be installed along the interface between the retained backfill zone and the adjacent soil.  345\nIn addition, geotextiles Type 2B in accordance with 918.02(a) shall be installed at all interfaces of coarse aggregate and finer soils when used in the foundation.\n\nCONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS 350\n\n731.06 General Requirements\nThe wall manufacturer\u2019s representative shall provide technical instruction, guidance in pre-construction activities including the pre-construction conference, and\non-site technical assistance to the Contractor during construction. 355\n731.07 Foundation Preparation  Prior to wall construction, the foundation for the structure shall be graded for a width equal to or exceeding the length of the ground reinforcement or as shown on the plans. The foundation, if not in rock, shall then be compacted in accordance with 203. 360\nAfter the foundation has been compacted, the resulting grade of the foundation shall be 1 in. per foot sloped from the back of the leveling pad downward toward the back\nof the reinforced zone. The portion of the foundation beneath the leveling pad shall\nnot be sloped. The foundation shall be proofrolled in accordance with 203.26. If\nunsuitable foundation material is encountered, it shall be removed and replaced with 365\nB borrow in accordance with 211.02 and compacted in accordance with 211.04.   After proofrolling has been completed and all unsuitable foundation material has been removed and replaced, compaction of the portion of the foundation beneath the\nreinforced backfill zone will be verified by DCP testing in accordance with ITM 509. 370\nOne DCP measurement for every 500 sq ft within the reinforced backfill zone and five DCP measurements per end bent will be performed.\nA DCP measurement is defined as the number of blows per 6 in. increment for a 375\ntotal penetration of 30 in., based on five sets of DCP readings at each location. A minimum of five blows of the DCP for each 6 in. increment is considered acceptable.  731.07\n849  Unsuitable areas shall be removed, replaced, and compacted in accordance with\n203 and 211. DCP verification of compaction beneath the reinforced backfill zone will 380\nnot be required if the foundation is in an embankment section that is constructed in accordance with 203.\nAn unreinforced concrete leveling pad shall be provided at each foundation level\nas shown on the plans. The leveling pad shall be cured in accordance with 702.22 for 385\na minimum of 12 h before placement of concrete face panels.   731.08 Retaining Wall Excavation  The Contractor shall notify the Engineer a minimum of 7 calendar days or other time as mutually agreed upon before beginning the excavation so that measurements 390\ncan be taken of the undisturbed ground.   Prior to starting excavation operations at the wall site, the area shall be cleared and grubbed to the excavation with the limits shown on the plans and in accordance with 201.03. All timber, stumps, or debris shall be disposed of in accordance with 395\n201.03.

The excavation shall be shored or braced in accordance with State and local safety 400\nrequirements. Excavation and related work shall be performed such that no portion of the wall is endangered by subsequent operations.   Where excavation for the wall requires shoring, sheeting, or bracing, the method shall be shown on the working drawings. Excavation operations shall not begin until 405\nthe Contractor receives notice that the working drawings are approved.\n\nAfter the excavation for the wall has been performed, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer. The material beneath the leveling pad shall be compacted in accordance with 203. Concrete for the leveling pad shall not be placed until the Engineer has 410\napproved the depth of the excavation and the foundation material. The leveling pad shall be in accordance with 731.07.

Video inspection will not be required.\n\n731.09 Wall Erection\nConcrete face panels shall be handled by means of a lifting device set into the 420\nupper edge of each panel. Panels shall be placed in successive horizontal lifts in the\nsequence shown on the plans as backfill placement proceeds. As backfill material is placed behind the panels, the panels shall be maintained in vertical position by means of temporary wooden wedges placed in the joint at the junction of the two adjacent 731.08\n850 panels on the external side of the wall. External bracing will be required for the initial 425\nlift.   Panels shall be stored on blocking to minimize contact with the ground or being covered by standing water. Panels placed in contact with the ground or covered by\nstanding water shall have face discoloration removed by means of a chemical wash. 430\nPlumb, vertical tolerances, and horizontal alignment tolerances shall not exceed 3/4 in. as measured with a 10 ft straightedge. The maximum allowable offset in panel joints shall be 3/4 in. For a wall of over 10 ft height, the overall plumb from top to bottom of the wall shall not exceed 0.05 in./ft of wall height. 435\nFor aesthetic considerations and to make differential settlement unnoticeable, the panels shall be erected such that the horizontal site line is discontinuous at every other panel. This shall be accomplished by starting erection with the lower panel level of each wall by alternating full-height and half-height panels. Panels above the lowest 440\nlevel shall be of a uniform size, except as required to top out the wall, to be in\naccordance with the plan elevations.\nThe Contractor shall perform the necessary work to verify that the foundation is at the correct elevation, that the wall is constructed to the correct alignment, and that 445\nthe work is in accordance with the specified tolerances. The checking of alignments and tolerances shall include verifying that the plumb of the face panels is in accordance with 731.10 over the entire height of the wall. Alignment shall be checked at each layer of panels after the backfill behind the panels has been compacted, and the results shall be recorded. 450\nThe connections of the ground reinforcement to the panels shall be in two\nelevations for full height panels. The connections shall not be more than 30 in.\nvertically apart. To prevent out-of-plane rotation, full height face panels shall be connected to the ground reinforcement on at least three different points in two different 455\nplanes. However, a preapproved system utilizing a horizontal stabilizing leg to prevent rotation shall require only ground reinforcement attachments in one plane. Partial size panels shall have three different connection points, but only one plane shall be attached\nto the ground reinforcement. Panels located at the top of the wall shall not be attached to the coping or traffic barrier. 460\nGround reinforcement shall be placed normal to the face of the wall, unless otherwise shown on the plans or as directed. Prior to placement of the ground reinforcement, backfill shall be compacted in accordance with 731.11.\n465\n731.10 Joint Spacers and Joint Covering for Wall Panels  Horizontal and vertical joint spacers shall be provided between adjacent face panels to prevent concrete-to-concrete contact and chipping if differential settlement\noccurs. Panels without an uninterrupted vertical joint shall have a minimum joint thickness of 3/4 in. Joint covering shall be provided and attached to the rear face of 470 731.10\n851 the panels. Geotextiles used to cover the joint behind the MSE wall facing panels shall\nbe in accordance with 918.02(a), Type 2B.\n731.11 Backfill Placement\nBackfill placement shall follow erection of each course of panels and ground 475\nreinforcement. All sheeting and bracing shall be removed as the backfilling progresses.\nBackfill shall be placed to avoid damage or disturbance to the wall materials or misalignment of the concrete face panels.    All material for backfill shall be subject to approval and shall be free from lumps, 480\nwood, or other undesirable material. Wall materials that become damaged or disturbed during backfill placement shall be removed and replaced or corrected as directed. All misalignment or distortion of the concrete face panels due to placement of backfill outside the limits described herein shall be corrected as directed.  485\nB borrow shall be compacted in accordance with 203.23 or 203.24. For structure backfill Type 3, compaction shall consist of five passes with a vibratory roller and one\npass with the same roller in static mode. Compaction equipment shall be in accordance\nwith 409.03(d). All displacement or rutting of the aggregate shall be repaired prior to placing subsequent material. 490\nThe maximum loose lift thickness shall not exceed 9 in. However, lifts within 3 ft of the wall shall not exceed 5 in. in loose thickness. This lift thickness shall be decreased, if necessary, to obtain the specified density.  495\nCompaction within 3 ft of the back face of the concrete face panels shall be achieved by means of a minimum of five passes with a lightweight mechanical tamper, roller, or an alternative vibratory system.\n\nAt the end of each day's operation, the last level of backfill shall be sloped away 500\nfrom the wall units. Surface runoff from adjacent areas shall not enter the wall construction site.   Subsurface drainage for the pavement section shall be underdrains for MSE walls and shall be as shown on the plans. 505\nCutting or altering of ground reinforcement in the field shall not be performed unless one of the alternatives in Article 11.10.10.4 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications is followed and a compensating adjustment is made in the wall design. All adjustments shall be shown on revised working drawings, signed by, and 510\nshall bear the seal of a professional engineer, and submitted to the Engineer for\napproval. Cutting shall be considered only if adequate additional ground reinforcement\nis provided to produce the required strength shown in the approved calculations. If the ground reinforcement is shortened in the field, the cut ends shall be covered with a galvanized paint or coal tar to prevent corrosion of the metal. 515\n731.11\n852  731.12 Method of Measurement\nThe measurement of concrete face panels and wall erection will be based on the square foot of area contained within the neat line limits of the wall envelope shown on the plans and not that of the wall system supplier. 520\n\nConcrete leveling pad will be measured by the linear foot.

    "text": "803.01 Description  This work shall consist of welding aluminum alloys for highway structures. The welding terms used shall be in accordance with definitions included in the AWS 5\nDefinitions \u201cMD\u201d Welding and Cutting, AWS A3.0. Special conditions shall be fully explained by means of added notes or details.   The aluminum alloys to be welded under these specifications may be any of the\nfollowing ASTM alloy designations: 10\n(a) wrought non-heat-treatable alloys 3003, 3004, 5052,\n5083, 5086, 5456;\n(b) wrought heat-treatable alloys 6061, 6063; or    (c) cast heat-treatable alloy 356.0. 15 803.01\n918\nMATERIALS\n803.02 Materials\nMaterials shall be in accordance with the following: 20\n\nWelding Supplies ................................................ 924.01\nMaterial used for permanent backing shall be at least equivalent in weldability to\nthe base metal being welded. 25\n803.03 Welding Processes  The welding process shall be by the gas metal-arc process or the gas tungsten-arc\nprocess. Other processes may be used if prior approval is given.  30\n(a) Preparation of Materials\nJoint details shall be in accordance with design requirements and detail drawings.\nThe location of joints shall not be changed without approval.\nEdge preparation shall be by sawing, machining, clipping, or shearing. Gas 35\ntungsten-arc or gas metal-arc cutting may also be used. Cut surfaces shall meet the\nANSI surface roughness rating value of 1000. Oxygen cutting shall not be used.   Surfaces and edges to be welded shall be free from fins, tears, and other defects which would adversely affect the quality of the weld. Dirt, grease, forming or 40\nmachining lubricants, and organic materials shall be removed from the areas to be welded by cleaning with a suitable solvent or by vapor degreasing.\nThe oxide shall be removed from all edges and surfaces to be welded by wire\nbrushing or by other mechanical methods such as rubbing with steel wool or abrasive 45\ncloth, scraping, filing, rotary planing, or sanding just prior to welding. If wire brushing is used, the brushes shall be made of stainless steel. Hand or power driven wire brushes which have been used on other materials shall not be used. Where mechanical methods of oxide removal are found to be inadequate, a standard chemical method shall be used. Welding shall be done within 24 h after chemical treatment. When gas 50\ntungsten-arc welding with direct current straight-polarity is being used, all edges and surfaces to be welded shall have the oxide removed by a standard chemical method.   Welding shall not be done on anodically treated aluminum unless the condition is removed from the joint area to be welded. 55\n\n(b) Welding Procedure  All butt welds requiring 100% penetration, except those produced with the aid of backing, shall have the root of the initial weld chipped or machined out to sound metal before welding is started from the second side. Butt welds made with the use of 60\nbacking shall have the weld metal fused with the backing. Where accessible, backing 803.03\n919 for welds that are subject to computed stress or which are exposed to view on the\ncompleted structure and which are not otherwise parts of the structure, shall be removed and the joints ground or machined smooth. In tubular members, butt welds subjected to computed stresses shall be made with the aid of permanent backing rings 65\nor strips.\n\nThe procedure used for production welding of any particular joint shall be the same as used in the procedure qualification for that joint.  70\nAll welding operations, either shop or field, shall be protected from air currents or drafts so as to prevent any loss of gas shielding during welding. Adequate gas shielding shall be provided to protect the molten metal during solidification. The work shall be positioned for flat position welding whenever practicable. All weld joints shall be dry at the time of welding. 75\nThe size of the electrode, voltage and amperage, welding speed, gas or gas mixture, and gas flow rate shall be suitable for the thickness of the material, design of\njoint, welding position, and other circumstances attending the work. Gas metal-arc\nwelding shall be performed with direct current, reverse polarity. Gas tungsten-arc 80\nwelding shall be performed with alternating current or with direct current, straight\npolarity.   When the joint to be welded requires specific root penetration, the Contractor shall make a sample joint and a macro etched cross-section of the weld to demonstrate that 85\nthe joint welding procedure to be used is attaining the required root penetration. The sample joint shall have a length of at least 1 ft and shall be welded with the electrode, polarity, amperage, voltage, speed, gas mixture, and gas flow rate that are proposed to be used in production welding. Evidence on record may be accepted in lieu of the\nreceding test. 90\nWhere preheat is needed, the temperature of preheat shall not exceed 350\u00b0F for heat-treated alloys and 600\u00b0F for non-heat-treated alloys. The temperature shall be measured by temperature indicating crayons or by pyrometric equipment. Heat-treated alloys shall not be held at the maximum preheat temperature or at temperatures near 95\nthe maximum for more than 30 minutes.    (c) Weld Quality\nWelds will not be accepted if they contain cracks in the welds or in the adjacent base metal, copper inclusions, or porosity in excess of that allowed by the AWS D1.2 100\nStructural Welding Code.\n\nLack of fusion, incomplete penetration, or tungsten or oxide inclusions will be acceptable only if small and well dispersed.  105\nUndercut shall be no more than 0.01 in. deep when its direction is transverse to the primary stress in the part that is undercut. Undercut shall be no more than 1/32 in. 803.03\n920 deep when its direction is parallel to the primary stress in the part that is undercut.\nOverlap shall not be allowed. All craters shall be filled to the full cross-section of the welds. Welds having defects greater than the levels of acceptance specified herein 110\nshall be considered as rejected unless corrected in accordance with 803.03(e).\n(d) Inspection\nAll welds shall be inspected visually to determine compliance with 803.03(c). In addition, all welds subjected to computed stress shall be inspected by the dye penetrant 115\nmethod except as specified below. For highway sign structures, the dye penetrant method shall be used on butt welds in columns and main chord members; on fillet welds connecting columns to bases and main chord members, including the associated flanges, gussets, or main load carrying brackets or members; and on fillet welds connecting flanges to the main truss chord members. The dye penetrant tests shall be 120\nperformed in accordance with ASTM E165, Method B. Dye penetrant inspection may\nbe omitted provided that the inspector examines each layer of weld metal with a magnifier of 3X minimum before the next successive layer is deposited.\n(e) Corrections 125\nIn lieu of rejection of an entire piece or member containing welding which is unacceptable, the corrective measures listed below may be allowed if approval is obtained prior to making each repair. Defective welds shall be corrected by removing and replacing the entire weld, or as follows:  130\n1. Cracks in Welds or Base Metal  The full extent of cracks shall be determined by dye penetrant method or other positive means. The cracks shall be removed throughout their length and depth, and rewelded.\n135\n2. Excessive Porosity and Lack of Fusion\nAll defective portions shall be removed and rewelded.\n\n3. Copper or Tungsten Inclusions  All defective portions shall be removed and rewelded. 140\n4. Excessive Concavity of Crater, Undercut and Undersize Weld  The weld shall be cleaned and additional weld metal shall be deposited.\n5 .  O v e r l a p  145\nOverlap shall be reduced by removal of the excess weld metal.   The defective areas shall be removed by chipping or machining. Oxygen cutting shall not be used. Before rewelding, the joint shall be inspected to ensure all the\ndefective weld has been removed. If dye penetrant has been used to inspect the weld, 150\nall traces of penetrant solutions shall be removed with solvent, water, heat, or other suitable means before rewelding.  803.03\n921  803.04 Qualification of Procedures, Welders, and Welding Operators\nJoint welding procedures shall be qualified previously by tests prescribed in the 155\nAWS D1.2 Structural Welding Code. Evidence of previous qualification of the joint welding procedures to be employed may be accepted.\nAll welders and welding operators shall be previously qualified by tests in\naccordance with the AWS D1.2 Structural Welding Code. Evidence of previous 160\nqualification of the welders and welding operators to be employed may be accepted. The same process and type of equipment that is required for execution of the contract work shall be used in qualifying welders and welding operators."

Megohm Test Before Splice is Made at Detector Housing       for Lead-in Cable\nThe two wires and shield of the lead-in cable at the cabinet shall be isolated and taped. The test shall consist of recording four readings taken at the detector housing or handhole as follows: 420\n\n(1) Connect the first megohm probe to ground and the\nsecond probe to the shield. Record the reading.\n(2) Connect the first megohm probe to the first lead-in 425\nwire and the second probe to the shield. Record the\nreading. 805.09\n932\n(3) Connect the first megohm probe to the second\nlead-in wire and the second probe to the shield. 430\nRecord the reading.\n\n(4) Connect the first megohm probe to the first lead-in\nwire and the second probe to the second lead-in wire. Record the reading. 435\nThe lowest of the four readings taken above shall be recorded on the testing document for acceptance.      c. Megohm Test After Splice is Completed at Cabinet 440\nThis test shall be performed after the splice at the detector housing is completed. A water solution of one tablespoon of baking soda per pint of water shall be placed in\na metal container. The metal container shall be grounded and the splice shall be fully submerged in the solution for 2 minutes. With the splice submerged, the shield of the\nlead-in shall be connected to ground at the cabinet. One megohm probe shall then be 445\nconnected to ground and the other probe connected to one of the lead-in wires and the reading recorded.     2. Delay Amplifier Settings and Vehicle Simulator Test  After all detector loop testing is complete, the detector amplifiers shall be installed 450\nand settings adjusted for proper operation at the intersection.   The frequency setting shall be adjusted using the amplifier\u2019s display so that adjacent loops in the roadway that are connected to different loop amplifiers have a minimum difference of 5 kHz. This operating frequency setting does not apply to loops 455\nthat are adjacent to each other in the roadway but are connected to the same loop\namplifier.   The sensitivity setting shall be adjusted using the amplifier\u2019s display. With an average size front wheel drive vehicle with the front axle centered over the back loop 460\nof a series of loops, the sensitivity shall be adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.   The count output shall be enabled for all loops designated as counting loops. The number of loops setting shall be set for loops designated for counting purposes and 465\nshall be set to the number of loops connected to that loop amplifier.\nThis test shall be performed by dragging a test vehicle across the loops using a\nnon-conducting string. The test vehicle shall be fabricated with an 8 ft length of No. 6 bare copper wire formed into a 2 1/2 ft diameter circle. The two ends shall then be 470\nelectrically spliced.    The test shall be started with all detector amplifiers turned \u2018Off\u2019 except for one 805.09\n933 approach. All amplifiers for that approach shall be turned \u2018On\u2019 and adjusted to the\nproper settings. All traffic for the approach being tested shall be stopped and not 475\nallowed to cross any loops during the test procedure for that approach. The simulator shall be dragged slowly across each loop system in the same direction as to simulate a vehicle driving through the loop system. As the simulator crosses each loop an IMSA\nLevel II Certified Signal Technician shall verify that a call is displayed exclusively on\nthe corresponding loop amplifier, controller detector input and controller phases. After 480\ncompletely verifying the loops on the first approach the amplifiers shall be left \u2018On\u2019, and the amplifiers for the next approach to be tested shall be turned \u2018On\u2019 and adjusted to the proper settings. The same procedure shall be followed for each remaining approach.  485\nWith large intersections, as the test proceeds, it may become difficult to verify that the calls are going to the correct detector inputs. In this case, traffic control shall be used to stop vehicles before reaching the loops for as many approaches as needed to accurately complete the testing to the inspector\u2019s approval. Testing may be paused between lanes to allow traffic to clear. 490\n\n3. Acceptance Criteria  The Contractor shall record all test readings, in triplicate, on tabular forms provided by the Department or by copying the one included elsewhere herein.\n495\nThe Contractor shall complete, sign, and date the forms before submitting them to the District Traffic Engineer.

Redesign Engineering will be paid when a conceptual CRI has been 630\naccepted by the Department, but the final proposal is rejected.\n\nPayment will be made under:\nPay Item   Pay Unit Symbol 635\nContractor\u2019s Reasonable Design Cost\nfor CRI Proposal No. ____ .......................................... LS\nCost Reduction Incentive Proposal No. ____ ...................... LS\nRedesign Engineering, C RI Proposal No. ____ .................. LS 640\n109.05 Payment for Extra Work  A Change Order Request form, available on the Department's website, shall be submitted for review for all extra work prior to the Engineer drafting a change order.\nThe form shall describe any unique circumstances and shall include unit prices or lump 645\nsum prices utilizing standard Department pay items.   Extra work performed in accordance with 104.03 will be paid for by one of the following methods:  650\n(a) Agreed Price\nExtra work will be paid for at agreed upon unit prices or lump sum prices as documented on approved change orders. The Department will perform a cost analysis of the Contractor's unit price or lump sum price indicated on the Change Order Request form. 655\n\nBased on the results of the cost analysis, the Engineer may direct the Change Order Request form to be amended to incorporate additional information, including:     1. A detailed explanation of unique circumstances of the extra 660\nwork.\n2. The effect of the circumstances on the requested price.     3. A breakdown of the estimated costs for the categories of 665\nlabor, equipment, and materials in sufficient detail to enable the Engineer to determine the basis and amount of\nthe requested price.\n(b) Force Account 670\nThe Department may require the Contractor to perform extra work on a force\naccount basis when a price cannot be agreed upon in accordance with 109.05(a). The Contractor shall, when directed, submit a written proposal for the extra work prior to 109.05\n117 the start of the work. When directed, the proposal shall include the planned labor,\nmaterials, equipment, and schedule for the work.  675\nExtra work performed by force account will be documented on an approved change order and will be compensated in the following manner:\n\n1. Labor Costs 680\nFor all labor and foremen in direct charge of the specific operations, the Contractor will receive the rate of wage, or scale, agreed upon in writing before beginning work for each hour that said labor and foremen are actually engaged in such work.  685\nThe Contractor will receive the actual costs paid to, or in behalf of, workmen by reasons of subsistence and travel allowances, worker\u2019s compensation insurance premiums, unemployment insurance contributions, social security taxes, health and welfare benefits, pension fund benefits, or other benefits when such amounts are required by collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract generally 690\napplicable to the classes of labor employed on the work. The Contractor shall furnish\nsatisfactory evidence of the rate or rates paid for insurance premiums and tax.   An amount equal to 20% of the sum of the above items will also be paid to the Contractor. 695\n2. Bond and Insurance  For bond premium and property damage and liability insurance premiums, the Contractor will receive the actual cost, to which cost 10% will be added. The Contractor shall furnish satisfactory evidence of the rate or rates paid for such bond 700\npremium and insurance premiums.\n\n3. Materials  For materials accepted and used, the Contractor will receive the actual cost of such materials delivered on the work, including transportation charges paid by the 705\nContractor, exclusive of machinery rentals as hereinafter set forth, to which cost 12% will be added.     4. Equipment\nFor Contractor owned machinery, equipment, or tools, the rates shall be not more 710\nthan those listed in the current Rental Rate Blue Book as published by EquipmentWatch\u00ae. The rate used shall be the FHWA hourly rate which is the ownership cost rate plus the operating cost rate. Regardless of the time used, the\nownership cost rate shall be the hourly rate obtained by dividing the monthly Blue\nBook rate by 176 with appropriate adjustments made for region and age. Actual 715\ntransportation costs may be added to the FHWA rate.\n\nThe Department will only pay for machinery, equipment, or tools with an FHWA\nhourly rate of greater than $2.00 per hour as listed in the Rental Rate Blue Book 109.05\n118 published by EquipmentWatch\u00ae. 720\n\nThe Department will not pay for machinery, equipment, or tools which are not\nlisted in the Rental Rate Blue Book published by EquipmentWatch\u00ae unless the\nmachinery, equipment, or tools have a documented fair market value of greater than\n$2,000 per item. 725\n\nFor machinery, equipment, or tools not owned by the Contractor, the rate shall be\nas shown on invoices. Actual fuel, lubricant and transportation costs may be added to the rental cost. The Engineer may designate the use of the fuel percentage of the Rental Rate Blue Book operating cost rate in lieu of actual fuel and lubricant costs. No 730\npayment will be made for repairs to rented equipment.   For equipment that is operational, on-site, and necessary for force account work, but is idle due to conditions beyond the control of the Contractor, a standby rate will apply. The standby rate will also apply during the period of transportation and on-site 735\nassembly and disassembly of the equipment for transportation purposes.

If the Contractor elects not to enact such adjustments, there will be no adjusted payment made to the Contractor for changes in the cost of PG asphalt binder materials used on the project and the provisions of this specification will not be applied\nto the contract. PG asphalt binder material cost adjustments will not be added to the\ncontract at any time after the Contractor has elected not to enact such adjustments with 945\nsubmittal of the bid proposal. PG asphalt binder material cost adjustments will not be applied to alternate bid pavement items, but may be applied to the common items on contracts containing alternate bid pavement items.  109.05.3\n123  When the Contractor elects to enact PG asphalt binder material cost adjustments 950\nat the time the bid proposal is submitted, the Department will adjust payment to the Contractor due to an increase or decrease in the cost of PG asphalt binder material used on the project to produce HMA mixtures that are paid in accordance with 304, 401, 402, 410, 414, 610, or 718. Payment will be adjusted when an increase or decrease\nin the PG asphalt binder index for the contract is greater than or equal to 10.01%. 955\nPayment will only be adjusted when the total original or revised quantity of at least one HMA pay item exceeds 2,000 tons.   For contracts without any original HMA pay item quantity equal to or greater than 2,000 tons, adjusted payment will not be made until the revised quantity of at least one 960\nHMA pay item meets the quantity criteria.   The initial 2,000 tons of HMA will not be eligible for a payment adjustment.   The Department will determine a PG asphalt binder index from one or more 965\ncommercial services that provide regional indices. The PG asphalt binder index will\nbe maintained by the Department\u2019s Division of Materials and Tests and posted on the\nDepartment\u2019s website. The posting will include an explanation of how the index is determined. A monthly payment adjustment will be calculated for each HMA pay item placed on the contract during that month. The total PG asphalt binder adjustment 970\napplied to the contract each month will be the sum of the calculations for each HMA pay item. The payment adjustment for each HMA pay item will be calculated as follows:   For a price increase: 975\n\nMPA = (Q x Pb)/100 x LI x [(BI-LI)/LI - 0.10]\n\nFor a price decrease:  980\nMPA = (Q x Pb)/100 x LI x [(BI-LI)/LI + 0.10]\nwhere:    MPA  = Mixture Payment Adjustment, in dollars, calculated to the 985\nnearest 0.01 dollar for each HMA pay item.\nQ  = Quantity of a HMA pay item placed, in tons, entered to the\nactual 0.01 unit placed. The quantity will be calculated\nprior to calculation of any other quantity adjustment. 990\nPb  = Percent of virgin asphalt binder from the DMF, in the\nadjustment period, or JMF for the HMA mixture, entered to the nearest 0.1.\n995 109.05.3\n124       BI  = PG asphalt binder index for the month the HMA pay item\nis placed, reported to the nearest whole dollar.\nLI  = PG asphalt binder index for the contract. The LI for all\noriginal contract HMA pay items equals the BI for the 1000\nmonth immediately prior to the month of letting for the\ncontract. The LI for any HMA extra work pay item will be the BI for the month the unit price for the pay item is submitted by the Contractor.\n1005\nThe calculation of (BI-LI)/LI will be rounded to the nearest 0.001. Payment will only be adjusted when the absolute value of (BI-LI)/LI is equal to or greater than 0.101.   If HMA pay items are placed beyond the specified contract completion date for the contract, the Department will calculate pay adjustments on the BI for the month of 1010\nthe specified completion date or the month of placement, whichever result is less.\nThe unit price of PG asphalt binder payment adjustment will be $1.00 and the pay\nquantities will be in units of dollars.  1015\nPayment will be made under:    Pay Item   Pay Unit Symbol    Payment Adjustment, PG Asphalt Binder ........................... DOL 1020\n109.06 Eliminated Pay Items  If pay items contained in the Schedule of Pay Items are found unnecessary for the\nproper completion of the work, they may be eliminated from the contract as a change\norder. Such action shall not invalidate the contract. When notified of the elimination 1025\nof pay items, the Contractor will be reimbursed for actual work done and all costs incurred, including mobilization of materials prior to said notification. This material may, at the option of the Department, be purchased at the actual cost including freight to the Contractor, plus 12%.  1030\n109.07 Partial Payments\nThe contract may contain more than one project. Partial payments may be made\nonce each month as the work progresses or twice each month if it is determined that the amount of work performed is sufficient to warrant such payment. These payments will be based on estimates, prepared by the Engineer, of the value of the work 1035\nperformed and materials complete in place in accordance with the contract. No partial\npayment will be made or estimates submitted when the total value of the work performed since the last estimate amounts to less than $500.   Except as set out in 105 IAC 11-3-8 of the Rules for Prequalification of 1040\nContractors and Bidding, the balance, less all previous payments and less amounts 109.07\n125 claimed which are required to be held by the Department in accordance with IC 8-23-\n9-26 through 8-23-9-39, will be certified for payment.\nWithin 10 business days of receipt of payment for any such estimate, the 1045\nContractor shall make payment to all subcontractors, including lessors and material\nsuppliers, for the value of their work performed and materials complete in place in\naccordance with the contract. Failure to comply with this clause shall constitute a\nmaterial breach of the contract and may result in sanctions under the contract.  1050\nAny delay or postponement of payment among the parties may take place only for good cause, with the Department\u2019s written approval. The explanation from the Contractor shall be made in writing to the Department.   Upon receipt of a claim under IC 8-23-9-26,  the Department will retain out of the 1055\namount due the Contractor the amount of the claim. The amount to be retained will be withheld from partial payment estimates until the total amount of the claim has been retained.\n\nIn order to retain an amount when required by IC 8-23-9-26, the Engineer will 1060\napply a negative quantity to the contract liens pay item for the actual dollar amount of the claim. Upon resolution of the claim, the Engineer will post a positive quantity to the contract liens pay item equal to the amount originally retained. The final quantity of the contract liens pay item will be zero prior to final payment.  1065\nThe contract unit price for contract liens will be $1.00.\nPayment will be made under:\nPay Item   Pay Unit Symbol 1070\n\nContract Liens ................................................................... DOL\nNo allowance will be made for materials received which have not been incorporated into the work except in accordance with 111. 1075\n109.08 Final Payment\nWhen the work has been completed in accordance with the terms of the contract, a final estimate will be prepared for the work done and a copy will be furnished to the Contractor. Final payment will not be made to the Contractor until allowed by IC 1080\n8-23-9-26 through IC 8-23-9-39.\nAll prior partial estimates and payments will be subject to correction in the final\nestimate and payment.\n1085\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, final payment will be made within 180 days after acceptance of the project. Acceptance shall be considered as the date the Contractor is relieved of further maintenance as provided in 107.19 and as set out in 109.08\n126 the final acceptance letter. However, final payment shall not be made on an amount\nwhich is in dispute or the subject of a pending claim. However, final payment may be 1090\nmade on that portion of the contract or those amounts which are not in dispute or subject of a pending claim. Such partial payment shall not constitute a bar, admission, estoppel, or have any other effect as to those payments in dispute or the subject of a\npending claim. For the purpose of this section, a dispute exists when the Contractor\nmakes a claim for increase or decrease to any part of the contract or seeks additional 1095\ncompensation for any reason."

The areas where welding will be allowed will be established in writing.   704.04 Placing Reinforcement and Concrete  Applicable provisions of 703 shall apply to placing reinforcing bars. No concrete 35\nshall be placed until the reinforcement has all been placed, secured, inspected, and\napproved. Walkways shall be in accordance with 702.20(a). Placing of reinforcement during placing of concrete will not be allowed without prior written approval. Splices, when allowed, shall be at locations of least tension in the steel.\n40\nThe concrete deck pour sequence and procedure shall be submitted for approval a minimum of 14 days prior to the planned deck pour. The submittal shall include the following information:    (a) the contract number 45\n(b) the Contractor\u2019s name\n(c) the bridge file number   (d) the Contractor\u2019s proposed pour sequence   (e) the Contractor\u2019 proposed pour rate   (f) the approved concrete mix design  50\n(g) the delivery time from the concrete batching location to the jobsite.\n\nBridge approaches shall not be poured continuous with deck pours.\nIf, during the pour, the approved pour rate is not achieved, placement of transverse 55\nconstruction joints may be directed as shown on the plans. Placement of concrete shall be continuous between joints. Horizontal joints will not be allowed. 704.03\n662\nFloor drains shall be placed in gutters at locations shown on the plans and fastened securely before placing the surrounding concrete. The tops of the floor drains shall be 60\nno more than 1/2 in. below the adjacent gutter grade. The drains shall be constructed so drainage water is not discharged against portions of the structure.\n\nExpansion joints shall be constructed as shown on the plans and the material shall be in accordance with 906.01. 65\n704.05 Finishing Concrete\nConcrete shall be placed and spread to the approximate contour for the full width being placed. The concrete may then be consolidated using mechanical internal vibrators in accordance with applicable provisions of 702.20(c). Vibrators shall not be 70\nused to spread or move the concrete horizontally to the extent that they cause segregation. Excessive vibration shall be avoided.   The use of a self-propelled finishing machine shall be used on all structures when\neither a new floor or an overlay is placed. Concrete for the full width of all traffic lanes 75\nshall then be struck off to proper profile grade and cross-section by an approved, self-propelled, oscillating, finishing machine. The finishing machine may be for traffic lane widths or full width of the structure when approved. Manually operated strike-off may be used on areas outside of the width of traffic lanes or where required construction joints limit the length of deck pours to 60 ft or less. 80\nThe finishing machine shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of 508.04(b) except it shall have a minimum of one reciprocating non-vibrating screed. The weight of the machine shall not cause undue deflection of the bridge members or falsework. The machine shall travel on steel rails, pipe, or other approved grade 85\ncontrol, which shall be adequately supported by adjustable support securely fastened\nin place at spacing sufficiently close to prevent any appreciable deflection of the screed.    Welding of supports to structural bridge members will not be allowed. Prior to the 90\nplacing of concrete, rails for the machine support shall be set to correct elevations shown on the plans or as approved. Rails shall extend a sufficient distance beyond the area to be placed so that the machine clears all finishing operations. The screed or strike-off beam shall be made of metal or the bottom shall be metal-clad. The bottom of the screed or strike-off shall be adjusted to the true cross-section of the floor surface. 95\nThe machine shall make only the number of passes over the slab as required to obtain a uniform surface free of voids and reasonably true to the planned profiles and\ncross-section.\nAny necessary hand finishing after removing the rails and rail supports shall be 100\naccomplished promptly to fill any depressions and remove any roughness of the surface in the area from which the supports are removed. The longitudinal mechanical screeding method may be used when approved. A mechanical bridge deck finishing 704.05\n663 machine using a rotating cylinder setting approximately parallel to the longitudinal\nmovement of the machine and operating transversely may be used for screeding the 105\nbridge deck, when approved.   When a finishing machine is not used or required, the concrete shall be struck-off\nto the specified grade as soon as the concrete is placed and consolidated, by means of\na steel template or other satisfactory metal clad implement having a minimum width 110\nof 9 in. or greater.   For all methods of striking off the surface, an excess of concrete shall always be kept in front of the cutting edge. The strike-off shall go over the entire area only for the number of times necessary to produce the required profile and cross-section. The 115\nstrike-off process shall be in accordance with 508.04 except a vibrator on the strike-off will not be required.   Immediately after screeding to the required cross-section, the surface shall be\nchecked with a long-handled 10 ft straightedge of light construction, laid parallel to 120\nthe centerline at intervals of no more than 2 ft transversely and 5 ft longitudinally. In\ncase it is impracticable to operate the straightedge otherwise, it shall be operated from a footbridge or from bridges on the floor. All high spots shall be removed and depressions filled with fresh concrete and then leveled with a float having a blade approximately 5 ft long and 8 in. wide. Floating and manipulating concrete to fill 125\ndepressions shall be held to a minimum. Checking and leveling shall continue until the surface has the required contour and is free of voids. The application of water to the surface for the purpose of lubricating the floats and straightedges may be used only when absolutely necessary and shall be held to a minimum. The water applied for this purpose shall be limited to such quantity as may be applied by heavy fogging as 130\napproved.\n\nAs soon as the water begins to leave, the surface shall be given a final check with the lightweight straightedge. The required cross-section shall be preserved. The final surface shall be free from porous spots caused by the disturbance of coarse aggregate 135\nparticles during the final checking and brooming. If a new bridge deck is to be overlaid with latex modified concrete, the surface of such deck shall be heavily broom textured to provide maximum bonding of the overlay material.   Just before the concrete has taken the initial set, the ends of slabs, exposed edges, 140\nand transverse construction joints shall be rounded to a 1/4 in. radius. Longitudinal construction joints shall not be edged unless otherwise directed.\nSmoothness shall be in accordance with 502.20. If, after the above requirements\nhave been met, portions of the floor are not entirely satisfactory, the removal and 145\nreplacement of such portions may be ordered to secure a satisfactory floor. Such removal and replacement shall be done with no additional payment.   After final smoothness checking, the surface shall be longitudinally grooved in 704.05\n664 accordance with 722.11. 150\n704.06 Curing  Floor slabs shall be cured in accordance with 702.22(a)1.

This will 5\nconsist of a program which will require the aggregate source to make a commitment\nto product quality management. Approval to participate in the program will be based on the following criteria:\n(a) existence of suitable materials in the deposit being mined, 10\n(b) facilities capable of consistently processing uniform materials\nin accordance with the specification requirements, and\n(c) a source QCP which will ensure that the mineral aggregates 15\nhave a 95% assurance of being in accordance with the Department\u2019s quality and uniformity requirements.\nSpecific details of the CAPP are contained in ITM 211. Additional details about\nthe program are included in the CAPP Training Manual for Producer Technicians. A 20\nCertified Aggregate Producer shall operate in accordance with both publications.\n917.02 Quality Control Plan\nAn aggregate source will not be included on the QPL of Certified Aggregate\nProducers until it has prepared a QCP and the plan has been approved.

The QCP shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of ITM 211.\n917.03 Source Approval Requirements 30\nThe Department\u2019s Division of Materials and Tests shall be notified in writing that\nthe aggregate source wants to become a Certified Aggregate Producer. The aggregate source shall identify the specific products it will work to qualify for initial source certification. Additionally, the source shall identify all products to be produced at the source regardless of whether the products are for Department or other uses. 35\nAn aggregate source may not be considered for entry into the certification\nprogram until the preliminary source investigation has been completed in accordance with ITM 203. 40\nThe following procedure will be used to establish an aggregate source as a\nCertified Aggregate Producer.\n(a) Step 1\nThe source shall enter the coordinated testing phase of ITM 211. Coordinated 45\ntesting shall be performed in accordance with ITM 211. During this phase, the 917.01\n1150 producer shall be required to develop a QCP to establish demonstrated mean test\nvalues and standard deviations.\n(b) Step 2 50\nThe aggregate source shall enter the trial phase. The producer shall also operate\nin accordance with ITM 211 and the QCP. The QCP shall be refined as may be\nnecessary.\n(c) Step 3 55\nThe aggregate source will be included on the QPL of Certified Aggregate\nProducers following satisfactory performance during the trial phase and successful completion of the trial phase audit. Achieving such status shall be accompanied by the inherent responsibility to operate within the tenets of ITM 211.  60\nThe Certified Aggregate Producer shall produce material at a compliance\nrequirement of a minimum of 95% of the appropriate specifications. The Department will monitor such compliance through periodic in-depth inspections and annual audits\nof the production site and source records. Initial and ongoing certification is contingent\nupon the effectiveness of the producer\u2019s QCP as evidenced by the quality and 65\nuniformity of the products which are prepared in accordance with the specifications\nand ITM 211.\n917.04 Removal from Certified Producer Status\nThe Department\u2019s Division of Materials and Tests will be responsible for the 70\nreview and removal of an aggregate source from the QPL of Certified Aggregate Producers. A Certified Aggregate Producer shall operate to avoid the need for the Department to exercise this action. However, removal from Certified Aggregate Producer status may be necessary for situations such as:\n75\n(a) the statistical probability of the product compliance has fallen\nbelow 90%,\n(b) the product has a 90% to 95% probability of compliance, but\nthe producer has failed to take corrective action to restore 95% probability, 80\n(c) the Certified Aggregate Producer has failed to take immediate\ncorrective action relative to deficiencies in the performance of the approved QCP,\n(d) evaluation of data has demonstrated an inability of the Certified\nAggregate Producer to consistently be in accordance with 85\nDepartment requirements,\n(e) the Certified Aggregate Producer has deliberately shipped\naggregate material which is not in accordance with the specifications, or has falsified records, or\n(f) the production site has not been operated in accordance with the 90\nSummary of Production or Ledge Quality Results letter.917.04\n1151 Notice of removal from Certified status will be in written form and will be issued\nby the Department\u2019s Division of Materials and Tests. The notice will identify the\nreasons for the removal. Effective immediately upon receipt of such notification, no 95\nfurther aggregate shipments shall be made on a certified basis.\n917.05 Producer Disputing Determination to Decertify\nThe producer shall have the right to dispute removal from Certified Producer\nstatus to the Engineer. The reasons the producer is disputing the decision shall be 100\nprovided in written form and shall be received within 14 calendar days of receipt of\nthe decertification notice."
